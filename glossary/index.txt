    bucket
        A container for storing similar mail :term:`conversations <conversation>` together. Common buckets are: Leads, Receipts, Newsletters, Refunds, and Spam. Buckets aren't the only means for organizing mail, but they're the simplest to understand and use.

    Cerb5
        A web-based communications platform for collaborating with a large audience.

    contact
        A person who corresponds with the :term:`helpdesk`. These are your customers, partners, and prospects. If you're part of the I.T. department for a large corporation, then contacts are likely your co-workers who ask questions and report problems.

    context
        A specific kind of :term:`object`.

    conversation
        A series of email messages pertaining to a specific topic and involving the same :term:`recipients <recipient>`.

    database
        Provides long-term storage for arbitrary information (i.e. data). Databases help applications maintain relationships between data (e.g. *"Which products were shipped for order #1234?"*), and they assist with performing complex analysis (e.g. *"How many orders over the past 12 months were from someone who has a surname that begins with F (AND) resides in Germany (AND) spent more than $100 USD?"*).  See: :term:`MySQL`

    Devblocks
        A commercial open source framework created by :term:`WebGroup Media <WGM>` for rapid :term:`PHP5 <PHP>` application development which provides many reusable "nuts and bolts" services. This approach enables a development team to spend more time solving their project's target problem.  Devblocks has been heavily influenced by over 10 years of experience working on :term:`Cerb5`, agile methodologies like extreme programming, and many innovative frameworks like Eclipse/RCP (cross-platform native desktop apps in Java), Tapestry (web development), and Hibernate (object relational mapping).

    event

    group
        A collection of :term:`workers <worker>` who share responsibility for the same conversations and :term:`buckets <bucket>`. Common groups are: Sales, Support, Development, Billing, and Corporate. These examples happen to all be departments, but groups can be established based on any attribute (e.g. product, location, etc).

    helpdesk
        A web-based hub for centrally managing and archiving :term:`conversations <conversation>`, and routing messages between :term:`workers <worker>` and :term:`contacts <contact>`. This allows multiple :term:`workers <worker>` to send and receive email from shared mailboxes without disclosing their personal contact information.

    inbox
        By default, where new :term:`conversations <conversation>` are delivered to a :term:`group`. These conversations are then dispatched automatically by :term:`Virtual Attendants <Virtual Attendant>` or manually by :term:`workers <worker>`.

    manager
         A :term:`member` with :term:`group` administration authority. Managers can create :term:`buckets <bucket>`, add new group members, and establish routing rules for new work. Groups can have any number of managers.

    mask
        A unique identifier (e.g. ABC-12345-987) that doesn't disclose sensitive statistics like the total number of :term:`conversations <conversation>` or the volume of activity over arbitrary time periods.  Sequential IDs (e.g. 1, 2, ...) expose these statistics with every new object.

    member
        A :term:`worker` in a :term:`group`, under the supervision of one or more :term:`managers <manager>`.

    LAMP stack
        An acronym referring to the use of :term:`Linux`, :term:`Apache`, :term:`MySQL`, and :term:`PHP` for building web applications.

    outcome
        ...

    PHP
        PHP Hypertext Preprocessor.  A widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development.  The primary programming language used to build :term:`Cerb5`.  The letter P in the :term:`LAMP <LAMP stack>` acronym.

    plugin
        ...

    privilege
        Explicit permission to perform a specific action.

    watcher
        A worker who subscribes to notifications about new activity on specific objects. For example, a manager may assign a task to another worker, and add themselves as a watcher to the task so they can be automatically notified about progress and completion. Being a watcher on something *does not* imply that you are taking responsibility for it. If you aren't sure how to answer a particular question, it can be useful to watch it so you can leave from the answer a more experienced worker gives. Watching facilitates collaboration, observation, and training.
