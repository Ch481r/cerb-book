    action
        An action performs a specific task in a :term:`Virtual Attendant`.

    address book

    Apache
        A popular web server which is used to server webpages. The letter A in the :term:`<LAMP stack>` acronym.

    behavior

    bucket
        A container for storing similar mail :term:`conversations <conversation>` together.  Common buckets are: Leads, Receipts, Newsletters, Refunds, and Spam.  Buckets aren't the only means for organizing mail, but they're the simplest to understand and use.

    Cerb
        A web-based communications platform for collaborating with a large audience.  Originally known as Cerberus Helpdesk, the project was started in January 2002 to help online teams efficiently distribute and handle large volumes of work: customer support questions, technical problems, tasks, sales opportunities, business partnerships, and more.

    condition
        A conditions is the comparison of a single property to one or more values using an operator.  Conditions control whether an :term:`outcome <outcome>` should be run or not.

    contact
        A person who corresponds with the :term:`helpdesk`.  These are your customers, partners, and prospects.  If you're part of the I.T.  department for a large corporation, then contacts are likely your co-workers who ask questions and report problems.

        A series of email messages pertaining to a specific topic and involving the same :term:`recipients <recipient>`.

    database
        Provides long-term storage for arbitrary information (i.e.  data).  Databases help applications maintain relationships between data (e.g.  *"Which products were shipped for order #1234?"*), and they assist with performing complex analysis (e.g.  *"How many orders over the past 12 months were from someone who has a surname that begins with F (AND) resides in Germany (AND) spent more than $100 USD?"*).  See: :term:`MySQL`

    decision

    Devblocks
        A commercial open source framework created by :term:`WebGroup Media <WGM>` for rapid :term:`PHP5 <PHP>` application development which provides many reusable "nuts and bolts" services.  This approach enables a development team to spend more time solving their project's target problem.  Devblocks has been heavily influenced by over 10 years of experience working on :term:`Cerb`, agile methodologies like extreme programming, and many innovative frameworks like Eclipse/RCP (cross-platform native desktop apps in Java), Tapestry (web development), and Hibernate (object relational mapping).

    event
        An event is triggered when something noteworthy occurs.  Events are used to cause :term:`Virtual Attendants <virtual attendant>` to run.

    group
        A collection of :term:`workers <worker>` who share responsibility for the same conversations and :term:`buckets <bucket>`.  Common groups are: Sales, Support, Development, Billing, and Corporate.  These examples happen to all be departments, but groups can be established based on any attribute (e.g.  product, location, etc).

    helpdesk
        A web-based hub for centrally managing and archiving :term:`conversations <conversation>`, and routing messages between :term:`workers <worker>` and :term:`contacts <contact>`.  This allows multiple :term:`workers <worker>` to send and receive email from shared mailboxes without disclosing their personal contact information.

    inbox
        By default, where new :term:`conversations <conversation>` are delivered to a :term:`group`.  These conversations are then dispatched automatically by :term:`Virtual Attendants <Virtual Attendant>` or manually by :term:`workers <worker>`.

    manager
         A :term:`member` with :term:`group` administration authority.  Managers can create :term:`buckets <bucket>`, add new group members, and establish routing rules for new work.  Groups can have any number of managers.

    mask
        A unique identifier (e.g.  ABC-12345-987) that doesn't disclose sensitive statistics like the total number of :term:`conversations <conversation>` or the volume of activity over arbitrary time periods.  Sequential IDs (e.g.  1, 2, ...) expose these statistics with every new object.

    member
        A :term:`worker` in a :term:`group`, under the supervision of one or more :term:`managers <manager>`.

    LAMP stack

    MySQL
        A popular open source :term:`database` used by :term:`Cerb`.  The letter M in the :term:`LAMP <LAMP stack>` acronym.

    notification
        ...

    object
        A specific instance of a :term:`context`.  For example, an individual :term:`ticket` or :term:`task`.

    outcome

    PHP
        PHP Hypertext Preprocessor.  A widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development.  The primary programming language used to build :term:`Cerb`.  The letter P in the :term:`LAMP <LAMP stack>` acronym.

    plugin
        A plugin adds new functionality to :term:`Cerb <cerb>`.  Plugins usually add new :term:`contexts <context>` to the app.

    privilege
        Explicit permission to perform a specific action.

    recipient
        A :term:`contact` that is associated with a particular :term:`conversation`.  Recipients receive a copy of every new message.

    Virtual Attendant
        A set of actions which is triggered by :term:`events <event>`.  Virtual Attendants can have any combinations of :term:`outcomes <outcome>` and :term:`actions <action>`.

    watcher
        A worker who subscribes to notifications about new activity on specific objects.  For example, a manager may assign a task to another worker, and add themselves as a watcher to the task so they can be automatically notified about progress and completion.  Being a watcher on something *does not* imply that you are taking responsibility for it.  If you aren't sure how to answer a particular question, it can be useful to watch it so you can leave from the answer a more experienced worker gives.  Watching facilitates collaboration, observation, and training.
