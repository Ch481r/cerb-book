    -  A **database** provides long-term storage for arbitrary information
       (*data*). Databases help applications maintain relationships between
       data (e.g. *"Which products were shipped for order #1234?"*), and
       they assist with performing complex analysis (e.g. "*How many orders
       over the past 12 months were from someone who has a surname that
       begins with F (AND) resides in Germany (AND) spent more than $100
       USD?*").
