Philosophy
----------

We believe in commercial open source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  We've never felt entirely comfortable using tools that hide their source code, so we share **100%** of ours on `GitHub <http://github.com/wgm/cerb5>`_.
- Our industrious community shares thousands of extra eyes and minds, and shoddy work wouldn't make it past their enthusiastic scrutiny. 
-  There will always be people who bypass the license, steal code, or copycat our innovative concepts. We're not going to be paranoid about it and mistrust everyone.
- If people have to be forced into financially supporting our work then we went very wrong somewhere.  Our target audience wants us to succeed.

We believe in agile development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  We're not interested in holding back useful improvements for months just to have a more marketable announcement.
-  Every few weeks we publish updates based on community feedback.
-  We don't want to make hostages out of bug fixes and usability tweaks.  We won't charge you for them.
-  All of our development and planning tools are open to the community.

We believe in platforms and toolkits
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  There are thousands of competing projects that are only interested in solving simple problems. We pick up where they left off.
-  We don't want to build schizophrenic software that forces everyone's opinions on everyone else.
-  We want you to see our work as a great starting point for the solution you've always wanted. We'll help you add the  finishing touches.
-  People are used to asking what software wants them to do. We believe in taking the time to retrain people that they should be in control.
- It's rewarding to see people using our tools to solve problems we never anticipated in creative ways that we never thought of.

We believe software is art
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Encyclopedia Britannica defines art as *"A visual object or experience consciously created through an expression of skill or imagination."*
-  We feel so many other projects think art means *"indulging fads with shiny interfaces"*.
-  Subtle beauty is important, but it looks like clown makeup when aesthetics try to hide a lack of depth, usability, flexibility, stability, scalability, and maintainability.
