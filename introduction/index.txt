**Cerb** is a fast and flexible toolkit for web-based collaboration and workflow automation.  In addition to equipping small teams with an arsenal of productivity-enhancing tools, the project also serves as a plugin-driven web development platform.

Cerb provides:

* Distributed email management that can scale to millions of conversations per year
* Virtual Attendants for the intelligent automation of repetitive behavior
* Shared pages for workers and groups to enhance productivity with their own workspaces
* Dashboards for reporting, monitoring, goal setting, and operational intelligence
* Contact information management for remembering anything about anyone
* Targeted broadcasting of personalized messages to thousands of contacts at once
* Notifications for keeping workers up to date about new activity
* Task management for delegating responsibilities
* Knowledge management for sharing accumulated experience
* Mobile functionality for reading notifications, using workspaces, and interacting with Virtual Attendants
* :doc:`Devblocks </developer_guide/devblocks/index>`, a plugin-driven web development framework, for rapidly implementing new functionality
* A library of third-party plugins for integrating with other applications and services (e.g. Facebook, Twitter, Twilio, Freshbooks, Amazon S3, JIRA, Campfire, etc)
* ... Time tracking, call logging, opportunity management, and much more

Cerb is the result of over 11 years of continuous research and development by :term:`Webgroup Media <Webgroup Media LLC>`.  The software is distributed under the Devblocks Public License as a commercial open source project.  It has evolved based on feedback from a community that has included more than 18,979 organizations.

Licenses are sold based on the number of simultaneous workers (i.e. :term:`seats <seat>`).  Community licenses provide up to three seats at no cost.  The software can be deployed on your own servers, or it can be subscribed to as an "on-demand" service that requires only a web browser.

Cerb is written in the :term:`PHP5 <PHP>` programming language.  Data is stored in a :term:`MySQL` database.  The source code is publicly available on `GitHub <https://github.com/wgm/cerb6>`_.
