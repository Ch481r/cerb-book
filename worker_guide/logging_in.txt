Logging In
----------

Each worker is given an account in Cerb with specific group members and privileges.  The first step in using Cerb is to log in to your account.

#. Open your web browser and visit the URL that you were given by a manager or administrator.  This may have been sent to you by email.

#. Enter your email address in the :guilabel:`Sign On` form.  You most likely want to check the :guilabel:`Remember me` box so you won't have to repeat this step in the future.
