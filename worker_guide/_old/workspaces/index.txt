Workspaces
==========

A **workspace** is a custom-built page that is owned by a role, group, or worker.

A group-owned workspace can be modified by that group's managers, and its contents can be viewed by all members.

Workers can also create their own private workspaces that they have full control over.

Frequently used workspaces can be added to a worker's global navigation menu as shortcuts.

Workspaces are divided into a series of **tabs**.  There are three main types of tabs: worklists, dashboards, and calendars.  Additional tab types may be added through :doc:`plugins </plugins/index>`.  New tabs are added by clicking on the last tab labeled with a plus sign (:guilabel:`+`).
