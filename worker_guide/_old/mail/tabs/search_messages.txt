Search Messages
---------------

The **Search Messages** tab searches through the mail archive and provides results as messages. This is useful when you want to be able to match individual messages on a conversation as distinct results.

This is the best place to display a list of outgoing messages that behaves like a 'Sent' folder in a traditional email reader.
