The time tracking overlay displays the amount of time that has elapsed since the :guilabel:`Track Time` button was clicked, and contains two buttons - a :guilabel:`pause` button and a :guilabel:`stop` button.  Clicking the pause button will pause the timer, and clicking the stop button will display the :guilabel:`Time Tracking` dialog.

    Link to comments doc, update image for custom fields

The **activity**, **time spent**, **log date**, **status**, and **watchers** can all be specified in the dialog.  If any custom fields have been defined for time tracking entries, they can be specified as well. There is also a comment box so you can quickly leave a comment on the time tracking entry when you create it.  Clicking the :guilabel:`Resume` button will allow you to resume the timer where it left off, though any data entered into the dialog will be lost.

Worklist
========

The :doc:`worklist </concepts/worklists/index>` is displayed just below the tabs.  At the top of the worklist are the currently applied :doc:`filters </concepts/worklists/filters>`.  Just below the filters, on the right side of the worklist, you have access to :doc:`subtotals </concepts/worklists/subtotals>`, :doc:`copy </concepts/worklists/copy>`, and :doc:`export </concepts/worklists/export>`.  Beneath the worklist is a toolbar of :doc:`actions </concepts/worklists/actions>` you can perform on the selected results.
