Search Tickets
--------------

The **Search Tickets** tab searches through the mail archive and provides results as tickets. This means that even if multiple messages from a conversation match they will be represented by a single result.

This is the best place to display all the conversations in the system, regardless of their status or other factors that prevent them from being displayed on the Workflow tab.
