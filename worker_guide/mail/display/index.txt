Display
-------

The display page is divided into two sections.  The top section of the display page provides you quick access to the properties of the ticket and a toolbar which allows you to quickly perform actions on the ticket.  The bottom section of the page is a group of tabs which control what content is displayed.  The :guilabel:`organizations` link at the very top of the page takes you back to the :doc:`organizations tab</worker_guide/address_book/tabs/organizations>`.
