Replying and Forwarding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The reply/forward form allows you to reply to or forward a ticket.  It is similar to creating a new message in any modern email application.  A draft is saved automatically when you first open the reply form.  Drafts are also saved every 30 seconds.  If you leave the page before completing your message, you can easily resume the draft at a later date.
