Messages and Comments
=====================

By default, the comments and messages are displayed in reverse chronological order - newer replies and comments appear at the top, and older ones appear at the bottom.  In addition, all messages except for the most recent are minimized by default, unless they have a sticky note attached to them.  Saved drafts are displayed at the very top of the ticket, and they can be resumed by clicking on the :guilabel:`resume` link or deleted by clicking the :guilabel:`delete` link.

Each maximized message has a toolbar with several buttons at the bottom.

Replying
^^^^^^^^

The reply form allows you to reply to a ticket.  It is similar to creating a new message in any modern email application.  A draft is saved automatically when you first open the reply form.  Drafts are also saved every 30 seconds.  If you leave the page before completing your message, you can resume the draft at a later date.

Sticky Note
~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Sticky Note` button allows you to add a Sticky Note to a message. Sticky Notes are similar to comments, but they are attached to individual messages and also force the message to be maximized when loading a ticket.
