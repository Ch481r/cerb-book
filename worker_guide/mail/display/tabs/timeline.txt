Messages and Comments
=====================

By default, the comments and messages are displayed in reverse chronological order - newer replies and comments appear at the top, and older ones appear at the bottom.  In addition, all messages except for the most recent are minimized by default, unless they have a sticky note attached to them.  Saved drafts are displayed at the very top of the ticket, and they can be resumed by clicking on the :guilabel:`resume` link or deleted by clicking the :guilabel:`delete` link.

Each maximized message has a toolbar with several buttons at the bottom.

Replying and Forwarding
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The reply/forward form allows you to reply to or forward a ticket.  It is similar to creating a new message in any modern email application.  A draft is saved automatically when you first open the reply form.  Drafts are also saved every 30 seconds.  If you leave the page before completing your message, you can easily resume the draft at a later date.

    :figclass: bordered

Recipients can be added by entering them into the :guilabel:`To` field.  Recipients should be separated by commas, and the field will auto-complete each recipient as you type it. Any recipients specified in the :guilabel:`To` field will automatically be added as a requester on the ticket.

A list of suggested requesters is also displayed just below the :guilabel:`To` field.

The :guilabel:`Cc` and :guilabel:`Bcc` fields behave the same way they do in a regular email client.  Addresses added to either of these fields are not added as a requester on the ticket.

Sticky Note
~~~~~~~~~~~

The :guilabel:`Sticky Note` button allows you to add a Sticky Note to a message. Sticky Notes are similar to comments, but they are attached to individual messages and also force the message to be maximized when loading a ticket.
