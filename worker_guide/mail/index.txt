The **mail** page is where you read, reply to, and initiate :doc:`email conversations </concepts/contexts/ticket>`. These conversations are shared with other :doc:`workers </concepts/contexts/worker>` in the :doc:`groups </concepts/contexts/group>` you are a member of.

Toolbar
=======

The toolbar at the top of the mail page contains one button and the quick search box.

Send Mail
~~~~~~~~~

Clicking the :guilabel:`Send Mail` button allows you to create a new email conversation.  You can either send a message to several :term:`recipients <recipient>`, or log details about a conversation that already took place elsewhere (for example, a meeting or phone call).

Quick Search
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :doc:`quick search </concepts/objects/quick_search>` box is a time-saving feature that allows you to perform a search from most pages in the mail section without having to navigate to the search page first.

Tabs
====

The rest of the mail page is divided into a series of :doc:`tabs </concepts/ui/tabs>` that provide specialized functionality:

    tabs/workflow
    tabs/search_tickets
    tabs/search_messages
    tabs/drafts

Worklist
========

The :doc:`worklist </concepts/worklists/index>` is displayed just below the tabs. At the top of the worklist are the currently applied :doc:`filters </concepts/worklists/filters>`. Just below the filters, on the right side of the worklist, you have access to :doc:`subtotals </concepts/worklists/subtotals>`, :doc:`customize </concepts/worklists/customize>`, :doc:`search </concepts/worklists/search>`, :doc:`copy </concepts/worklists/copy>`, and :doc:`export </concepts/worklists/export>`. Beneath the worklist is a toolbar of :doc:`actions </concepts/worklists/actions>` you can perform on the selected results.

Search
~~~~~~

Clicking :guilabel:`search` allows you to copy all of the filters on a worklist into a search. This is useful if you need to modify one of the default, hidden :doc:`filters </concepts/worklists/filters>` for that worklist.

Piles
~~~~~

Clicking :guilabel:`piles` at the top of the mail worklist allows you to easily perform bulk actions on tickets with similar properties, without having to setup a filter first.

.. figure:: /images/worker_guide/mail/piles.png
    :alt: The piles area.
    :figclass: bordered

The sorting options displayed at the top of the piles section allow you to group by :guilabel:`Subject`, :guilabel:`Senders`, or :guilabel:`Headers`. Selecting :guilabel:`Headers` will display an input box allowing you to enter a custom header, and a few common filters have been provided as links below the input box for convenience.
