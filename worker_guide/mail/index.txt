Mail

The **mail** page is where you read, reply to, and initiate :doc:`email conversations </concepts/contexts/ticket>`. These conversations are shared with other :doc:`workers </concepts/contexts/worker>` in the :doc:`groups </concepts/contexts/group>` you are a member of.

Toolbar
=======

There is a toolbar at the top of the mail page:

   :alt: The mail toolbar.

In the left side of the toolbar are the following buttons:

- **Send Mail:** This button creates a new email conversation.  You can either send a message to several :term:`recipients <recipient>`, or log details about a conversation that already took place elsewhere (for example, a meeting or phone call).

In the right side of the toolbar there is a :doc:`quick search </concepts/objects/quick_search>` text box. This time-saving feature allows you to perform a search from most pages in the mail section without having to navigate to the search page first.

Tabs
====

The rest of the mail page is divided into a series of :doc:`tabs </concepts/ui/tabs>` that provide specialized functionality:
