   Logging in

Let's log in and take a look. Enter your email address and password,
then click the *Sign On* button (or press ``ENTER`` after typing your
password).

Tour mode

   Tour mode

"Tour mode" is automatically enabled to provide basic training when you
log in for the first time. As you navigate through the software, the
yellow box at the top of the page will highlight relevant *points of
interest* based on where you are. Clicking on each item of interest will
display a speech bubble that highlights the location of the feature and
explains how to use it. Once you are familiar with the software you can
click the *hide this* link at the top right of the yellow box to disable
the tour. You can resume the tour from your worker settings.

Setting your basic account preferences
--------------------------------------

-  Click your name in the top right of any page to reveal a menu.
-  Select *Settings* from the menu.

Set *Timezone* to your current location. The software will use this
timezone when displaying dates and timestamps, making it easier for you
to do time-based comparisons.

If you are in a multilingual environment, set *Language* to your
preferred language. This will change all the text in the software. Any
text that does not have an available translation will be displayed in
English by default. This option won't translate individual email
messages; they will still be displayed in the language they were written
in.

If you have additional email addresses that you would like to associate
with your worker account you can add them in the *Email Addresses*
section. This is useful if you want to be able to relay mail to a mobile
email account. Keep in mind that these addresses will all represent your
worker account, so you don't need to add all your personal email
addresses unless you intend to use them for this purpose.

Once you have established your preferences, click the *Save Changes*
button at the bottom of the page.

A walkthrough demonstration

   The navigation menu.

The navigation menu at the top of each page divides the application into
sections based on the type of information being presented.

We'll now explore each of these sections and explain their
functionality. Keep in mind that some of the sections and features
listed below may not be visible if your account does not have access to
them. If this happens, skip ahead to the next section. You may also see
additional sections if various optional plugins are enabled.

Mail
~~~~

.. figure:: /images/getting_started/section_mail.png
   :align: center
   :alt: The mail section.

   The mail section.

The **mail** section is where you read, respond to, and initiate email
conversations. These conversations are shared with other workers in the
groups you are a member of.

There is a toolbar at the top left of the mail section with several
buttons:

-  *Send Mail* composes a new message to any number of contacts. Each
   contact will receive a copy of all future worker messages. The
   opening message will be outgoing and attributed to yourself. This
   should be how you start new conversations most of the time.
-  *Open Ticket* offers similar functionality to *Send Mail* with an
   important distinction: the conversation will be started as an
   incoming message attributed to the recipients. This is useful when
   you are creating a new conversation as a convenience for one of your
   contacts after discussing something on a phone call.
-  *Auto-Refresh* will automatically reload the page at the given
   interval. This is useful if you have multiple monitors and you want
   to be able to see new messages at a glance without manually reloading
   the page.

At the top right of the section there is a quick search text box. This
time-saving feature allows you to perform a search from most pages in
the mail section without having to navigate to the search page first.

The mail section is further divided by a series of tabs that provide
specialized functionality.

Workflow
^^^^^^^^

The **Workflow** tab is where you will spend most of your time in the
mail section. It is optimized for working with a large volume of mail by
highlighting conversations that are immediately actionable.

In many environments there are conversations that sit idle for long
periods of time because they're waiting for something: a reply from a
customer, a worker task to be completed, or a specific date and time.
Additionally, there are several kinds of mail that may never need a
response but can't be closed without being reviewed: vendor newsletters,
receipts, or automated reports. This work should be moved to a bucket
that has been flagged by a group manager as being hidden from Workflow.

Workflow focuses on conversations that you can do something about by
enforcing the following criteria:

-  It must be open (not closed, or waiting for a contact to reply).
-  It must be located in an inbox, or a bucket that is not hidden from
   Workflow.

The key to the efficient use of Workflow is to have groups and buckets
that are organized by the process required to complete the work
contained within them. For example, if you have buckets like *Receipts*,
*New Orders*, and *Leads*, you can repeat the same process for each
message in a bucket, while also reusing any resources you need in order
to complete them.

You can also use the subtotals feature to group conversations based on
criterion other than bucket.

The last thing you want to be doing is competing with a dozen workers
who are randomly grabbing work. Cerb5 is not meant to be used in a
social vacuum. Find a co-worker and tell them "I'll handle the new
orders if you want to go through the leads". If your team is too large
to organize with an informal process, you should nominate a group
*dispatcher* to make assignments, or you should use a real-time,
group-wide communication tool like Campfire by 37signals
(http://www.campfirenow.com/).

Search Tickets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Search Tickets** tab searches through the mail archive and
provides results as tickets. This means that even if multiple messages
from a conversation match they will be represented by a single result.

This is the best place to display all the conversations in the system,
regardless of their status or other factors that prevent them from being
displayed on the Workflow tab.

Search Messages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Search Messages** tab searches through the mail archive and
provides results as messages. This is useful when you want to be able to
match individual messages on a conversation as distinct results.

This is the best place to display a list of outgoing messages that
behaves like a 'Sent' folder in a traditional email reader.

Drafts
^^^^^^

The **Drafts** tab displays a worklist of messages that you have saved
but not yet sent. You can click on a draft to resume it.

Snippets
^^^^^^^^

The **Snippets** tab manages fragments of text that can be reused in
various conversations. For example, when a customer asks for your price
list you can simply insert the 'Price Sheet' snippet rather than
monotonously typing it by hand or copying and pasting it from your
website. Snippets can also contain placeholder text that will change
depending on where they are used; for example, a ``{{first_name}}``
placeholder would be replaced by the first name of the contact you are
talking to.

Configuring your Virtual Attendant
----------------------------------

1. Click on your name at the top right of any page to reveal a menu.
2. Select *Virtual Attendant* from the menu.

If necessary, you can review the topic of `Virtual
Attendants <#virtual-attendants>`_ in the `Concepts <#concepts>`_
chapter.

Sending notifications to email
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. raw:: html

   <!-- More efficient to use the wgm.notifications_emailer plugin -->

You can instruct your Virtual Attendant to send a copy of new
notifications to your email address.

.. figure:: /images/getting_started/va_email_notifications_weekend.png
   :align: center
   :alt: Our desired Virtual Attendant behavior.

   Our desired Virtual Attendant behavior.

It's quite simple to send a copy of all notifications to your email
address. First let's create a new behavior and give it a name:

1. Under *Create New Behavior*, choose *New notification for me*.
2. Click on the gray bubble with the words *New notification for me*.
3. Select *Edit Behavior* from the menu.

   .. figure:: /images/getting_started/va_email_notifications_menu.png
      :align: center
      :alt: The menu.

      The menu.
4. Set the text of *Title* to "Send notifications to email".
5. Click the *Save Changes* button.

Now that we've created a new behavior you could simply add a new action
to it and receive a copy of all your notifications by email. However, to
make this more interesting, let's imagine that you only want a copy of
your new notifications to be sent during the weekend. First, we want to
a new decision to the behavior:

1. In the *Send notifications to email* behavior, click on the gray
   bubble with the words *New notification for me*.
2. Select *Add Decision* from the menu.
3. Set the text of *Title* to "Is it a weekend?"
4. Click the *Save Changes* button.

Now we want to add a positive outcome to the new decision:

1. Click the gray decision bubble with the blue text *Is it a weekend?*.
2. Select *Add Outcome* from the menu.
3. Set the text for *Title* to "Yes"
4. Click the *Add Condition* button.
5. Type "day" and delete *Day of week* from the list.
6. Check the boxes for *Sun* and *Sat*.
7. Click the *Save Changes* button.

   .. figure:: /images/getting_started/va_email_notifications_outcome.png
      :align: center
      :alt: The outcome.

      The outcome.

Finally, we want to add an action to send our mail during the weekend:

1. Click on the gray outcome bubble with the green text *Yes*.
2. Select *Add Actions* from the menu.
3. Set the text of *Title* to "Send email".
4. Under *Add Action* select *Send email to me* from the list.
5. Set the text of *Subject:* to "[Notification] {{message}}"
6. Set the text of *Content:* to:

   {{message}}
   {{url}}

7. Click the *Save Changes* button.

   .. figure:: /images/getting_started/va_email_notifications_action.png
      :align: center
      :alt: The action.

      The action.

Now any time you receive a new notification during the weekend a copy
will be sent to your email address.

::

    Date: Sun, 15 May 2011 09:01:48 +0000
    Subject: [Notification] Manager Mark commented on task Evaluate Cerb5: I
     think it will do everything we want, and more! 
    From: "Example, Inc." <support@example.com>
    To: you@example.com

    Manager Mark commented on task Evaluate Cerb5: I think it will 
      do everything we want, and more!
    http://localhost/cerb5/tasks/display/1/comments

If you click on the link provided in the email then your browser will
open directly to the subject of the notification. In the example above
you would end up on a specific task that your manager left a comment for
you on.

Now that you understand how to forward your notifications to your email
address you can customize the behavior to do exactly what you want. For
example, if you want to send a copy of all notifications to your email
address, you can simply add an action directly to the new behavior (the
top gray bubble) and skip the steps for making a decision and an
outcome.

You could also change the decision to allow for different outcomes. If
you renamed the decision to "It is:", you could add outcomes for
"Weekend" and "Weekday After hours", each with their own action.
