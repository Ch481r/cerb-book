The **title**, **due date**, **completed**, and **watchers** can all be specified in the dialog.  If any custom fields have been defined for tasks, they can be specified as well. There is also a comment box so you can quickly leave a comment on the task when you create it.

~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :doc:`quick search </concepts/objects/quick_search>` box is a time-saving feature that allows you to quickly apply a filter to the worklist.
