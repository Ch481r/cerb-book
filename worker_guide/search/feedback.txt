Worklist
========

The :doc:`worklist </concepts/worklists/index>` is displayed just below the tabs.  At the top of the worklist are the currently applied :doc:`filters </concepts/worklists/filters>`.  Just below the filters, on the right side of the worklist, you have access to :doc:`subtotals </concepts/worklists/subtotals>`, :doc:`copy </concepts/worklists/copy>`, and :doc:`export </concepts/worklists/export>`.  Beneath the worklist is a toolbar of :doc:`actions </concepts/worklists/actions>` you can perform on the selected results.
