The navigation menu at the top of each page divides the application into sections based on the type of information being presented.

We'll now explore each of these sections and explain their functionality. Keep in mind that some of the sections and features listed below may not be visible if your account does not have access to them. If this happens, skip ahead to the next section. You may also see additional sections if various optional plugins are enabled.
