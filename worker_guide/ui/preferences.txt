Setting your timezone and language preferences
----------------------------------------------

Before moving on, let's configure your timezone and language:

-  Click your name in the top right of any page to reveal a menu.
-  Select :guilabel:`Settings` from the menu.

The :guilabel:`Settings` tab should be selected by default.  The :guilabel:`Account Settings` box is where you will find the settings that control your current timezone and selected language.

**Timezone**
    Set this dropdown menu to your current location.  The software will use this timezone when displaying dates and timestamps.

**Language**
    If you are in a multilingual environment, set this dropdown menu to your preferred language. This will change all the text in the interface. Any text that does not have an available translation will be displayed in English by default. This option won't translate individual email messages; they will still be displayed in the language they were written in.

Once you have established your preferences, click the :guilabel:`Save Changes` button at the bottom of the page.
