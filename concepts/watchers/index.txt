Watchers
--------

A **watcher** is a worker who subscribes to notifications about new activity on specific records. For example, a manager may assign a task to another worker, and add themselves as a watcher to the task so they can be automatically notified about progress and completion. Being a watcher on something *does not* imply that you are taking responsibility for it. If you aren't sure how to answer a particular question, it can be useful to watch it so you can leave from the answer a more experienced worker gives. Watching facilitates collaboration, observation, and training.
