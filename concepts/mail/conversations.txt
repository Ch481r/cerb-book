Conversations
-------------

A specific email conversation, including all of its messages, comments, and settings. Each ticket has a unique identifier (*ID*) for future reference by anyone involved. There are two kinds of IDs:

-  A *private ticket ID* is assigned by the database. Your first
   ticket is ID ``1``, and a year later the most recent ticket ID may
   be ``123500``. These IDs are *sequential*; in other words, they
   add 1 for each new ticket, starting from 1. There are many reasons
   you should not share these IDs:

   -  They are predictable. If someone knows that one particular
      ticket ID is ``1025`` then they are now aware of 1,024 other
      valid IDs.
   -  They give away the volume of your helpdesk. They can probe for
      the highest valid ID to determine how many tickets are in your
      database.
   -  They give away the velocity of your helpdesk. Your customers or
      competitors could create new tickets at regular intervals to
      gauge the traffic of your helpdesk. Many other software
      applications overlook this -- invoices are given sequential
      IDs, etc.

-  A *public ticket ID* is also referred to as a *mask*, because it
   doesn't betray any information about the volume or velocity of
   your helpdesk. Instead, ticket masks look like ``XER-83472-879``.
   Masks are designed to be short and verbally readable, while still
   providing a very large number of combinations. There are more
   combinations available in three letters (17,576) than there are
   for 3 numbers (1,000), so you can often enter the first three
   letters of a ticket mask to find a match without having to type in
   the whole thing. Masks are also very useful for verification
   outside of email (*"I need your email address and the first three
   letters of the ticket from the subject line"*).
