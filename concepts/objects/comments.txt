Comments
--------

**Comments** describe an internal discussion among :doc:`workers </concepts/contexts/worker>` on a particular :doc:`object </concepts/objects/index>`.  Comments are never publicly visible to :term:`contacts <contact>` or other external parties.  When leaving a comment, a worker can choose to :doc:`notify </concepts/notifications>` other workers in order to draw their attention to it.

A typical conversation in comments might occur as follows:
