Custom Fields
-------------

**Custom fields** allow you to add new :doc:`fields </concepts/objects/fields>` to the :doc:`objects </concepts/objects/index>` of a particular :doc:`context </concepts/contexts/index>`.

The design philosophy of Cerb is to make as few assumptions about your business as possible. Custom fields transform the software from a flexible, capable, off-the-shelf starting point to a solution that feels like it was crafted with your specific needs in mind.
