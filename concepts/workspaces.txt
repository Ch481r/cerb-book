Workspaces
----------

A **workspace** is a collection of related :doc:`worklists </concepts/worklists/index>`.  Workspaces allow groups and workers to focus on a specific subset of all the available data.

For example, a workspace may be created for a marketing campaign.  It might contain an :doc:`opportunity </concepts/contexts/opportunity>` worklist for unassigned leads, a worklist of :doc:`email addresses </concepts/contexts/address>` that form a custom mailing list, and a worklist of :doc:`tasks </concepts/contexts/task>` that are related to the leads.

Administrators can use and modify any workspace.  They may also create workspaces for any role, group, or worker.

There is no limit to the number of workspaces that may be created.

=======

Workspaces can be owned by:

- **Roles**
    A workspace owned by a :doc:`role </concepts/contexts/role>` is usable by all of its :doc:`workers </concepts/contexts/worker>`.  Workers cannot modify these workspaces.

- **Groups**
    A workspaces owned by a :doc:`group </concepts/contexts/group>` is usable by all of its :doc:`members </concepts/contexts/worker>`.  Only group managers can modify it.

- **Workers**
    A workspace owned by a :doc:`worker </concepts/contexts/worker>` is considered private.  Only that worker can view or modify it.
