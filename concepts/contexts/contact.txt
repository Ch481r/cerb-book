Contact
-------

An individual person who corresponds with the helpdesk is referred to as a **contact**. These are your customers, partners, and prospects. If you're part of the I.T. department for a corporation, contacts are often your co-workers who ask technical questions and report problems.

Multiple email addresses can be associated with the same contact -- reflecting the fact that an individual can have more than one email address.

You usually don't need to create contact objects manually.  Contact objects are automatically created when people register through any of your :doc:`community portals </concepts/community_portals>`.  This will also permit contacts to associate all their alternate email addresses with their account.
