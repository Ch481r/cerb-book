Contact
-------

An individual who corresponds with your team is referred to as a **contact**. These are your customers, partners, and prospects. If you're part of the helpdesk for a corporation, contacts are often your co-workers who ask technical questions and report problems.

Multiple email addresses can be associated with the same contact -- reflecting the fact that an individual can have more than one email address.

You usually don't need to create contact objects manually.  Contact objects are automatically created when people register through any of your :doc:`community portals </concepts/community_portals>`.  This will also permit contacts to associate their alternate email addresses with their own account.

Fields
======

Contacts have the following fields:

- **Email Address**
    The primary :doc:`email address </concepts/contexts/address>` for this contact.  This is used when :doc:`broadcasting </concepts/broadcast>` to contacts to prevent sending duplicate messages to alternate email addresses.

- **Password**
    The password used by this contact to log in to :doc:`community portals </concepts/community_portals>`.

- **Created Date**
    The date and time when this contact was added to the system.

- **Last Login Date**
    The date and time when this contact last logged into a :doc:`community portal </concepts/community_portals>`.  This is useful for building a list of contacts based on activity (or inactivity).
