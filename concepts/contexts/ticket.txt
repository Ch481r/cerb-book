Ticket
------

A **ticket** is a specific email conversation, including all of its messages, comments, and data. Each ticket has a unique *identifier* (**ID**) for future reference by anyone involved. 

Recipients
==========

:doc:`Contacts </concepts/contexts/address>` that are associated with a particular ticket are called **recipients**. Recipients receive a copy of every new message on a ticket.  Cerb5 routes messages between :doc:`workers </concepts/contexts/worker>` and recipients, allowing several workers to share a mailbox without disclosing their personal contact information.

IDs vs. Masks
=============

Tickets have two kinds of IDs:

- A *private ticket ID* is assigned by the database. Your first ticket has an ID of #1, and after a year of new tickets the most recent ticket ID might be something like #123,500. These IDs are *sequential*; in other words, the ID is incremented by one for each new ticket. There are many reasons you should not share these IDs:

    - They are predictable. If someone knows that one particular ticket ID is #1,025 then they are now aware of 1,024 other valid IDs.
    - They give away the volume of your mail activity. External parties can probe for the highest valid ID to determine how many tickets are in your database.
    - They give away the velocity of your mail activity. Your customers or competitors could create new tickets at regular intervals to gauge the traffic of your helpdesk. Many other software applications overlook this -- invoices are given sequential IDs, etc.

- A *public ticket ID* is referred to as a **mask**, because it doesn't betray any information about the volume or velocity of your helpdesk. Instead, ticket masks look like ``XER-83472-879``. Masks are designed to be short and verbally readable, while still providing a very large number of combinations. There are more combinations available in three letters (17,576) than there are for 3 numbers (1,000), so you can often search for the first three letters of a mask without having to type in the whole thing. Masks are also very useful for verification when you're not using email.  For example, you can ask a caller, *"I need your email address and the first three letters of the reference number from the subject line"*.

Statuses
========

Every ticket is considered to be in one of these four states:

- **Open**
    
    The conversation has a new message from a :doc:`contact </concepts/contexts/address>` and requires :doc:`worker </concepts/contexts/worker>` attention.
    
- **Waiting**

    The conversation has been updated by a worker and is currently waiting for whichever of these two events come first:
        - A new message from a contact.
        - A specific future date and time.
  
    In either event, the status will be changed to *open*.  Setting an explicit "wait until..." date on a conversation will allow you to followup with the contact even if they never write back.
    
    A :doc:`group manager </concepts/contexts/group>` can also *close* conversations that have been waiting for longer than a specific period (e.g. waiting for more than 30 days).
    
- **Closed**

    The conversation has been resolved satisfactorily and is archived.  If a new message is received from a contact then this status will be changed to *open*.
    
- **Deleted**

    The conversation is junk and it will be purged during a future maintenance period.  Until such time it can be changed to any other status to be recovered.

Fields
======

Tickets have the following primary fields:

- **Subject**
    The subject of a ticket serves the same purpose as the :mailheader:`Subject:` line in other email readers.
    
- **Mask**
    A unique identifier (e.g. ABC-12345-987) that doesn't disclose sensitive statistics like the total number of :term:`conversations <conversation>` or the volume of activity over arbitrary time periods.

- **Status**
    One of four states:
    
    - Open (worker action needed)
    - Waiting (recipient action needed)
    - Closed (resolved satisfactorily)
    - Deleted (trash)

- **Group**
    The :doc:`group </concepts/contexts/group>` that the ticket is assigned to.
    
- **Bucket**
    The :term:`bucket` of the current group where the ticket resides.  By default this will be an :term:`inbox`.
    
- **Organization**
    The :doc:`organization </concepts/contexts/organization>` that is associated with this ticket for reporting purposes.  If an organization isn't explicitly assigned, the organization of the initial sender will be used.

- **Owner**
    The :doc:`worker </concepts/contexts/worker>` responsible for completing this ticket.

- **Created Date**
    The date and time that this ticket was first opened.
    
- **Updated Date**
    The date and time of the most recent activity.

- **Last Action**
    The most recent conversational activity:
    
    - New conversation (first message)
    - Recipient replied (followup)
    - Worker replied

- **First Wrote**
    The :doc:`contact </concepts/contexts/address>` who wrote the opening message.

- **Last Wrote**
    The :doc:`contact </concepts/contexts/address>` who wrote the latest message.  This might be the helpdesk itself.

- **Interesting Words**
    The most interesting words found in this conversation's opening message as determined by the spam filter.  The least interesting words are found equally in spam and non-spam.  These are called *stop words*, referring to common words like: a, is, it, the, what, when, where, who, why, etc.  The most interesting words are those that occur only in spam or non-spam.  These words may be different in each environment.  For example, the word *pills* may be incriminating to a software company but expected for a health care organization.  The interestingness of words changes over time.  Manufactured words may be considered especially interesting (and spammy); for example, spammers often use tricks to disguise words: vi4gra, pi11s, w4tches, s0ftware, etc.  These words will probably never occur in normal conversation (though there are exceptions, like abuse reports that describe spam).
    
- **Spam Score**
    The computed probability that the contents of this ticket are spam.  This percentage will range from 0.01% (confidently not spam) to 99.99% (confidently spam).  A score of 50% describes a message that has an equal balance of incriminating and exonerating content.  The spam score is determined when the ticket is first opened, and it is *not* updated for subsequent messages.
    
- **Spam Training**
    The spam training feedback resulting from worker activity.  This can be one of three values:
    
    - None
        No training data has been provided.
    - Not spam
        This conversation has been verified as legitimate.  This training option is usually not set directly, since any worker reply to a conversation will automatically flag it as not being spam.  Training a conversation as not spam will give its interesting words more weight in determining legitimate messages.
    - Spam
        This conversation has been confirmed as spam.  This will give its interesting words more weight in identifying future junk mail.
