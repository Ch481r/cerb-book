Role
----

A **role** is a set of :term:`privileges <privilege>` granted to a :doc:`worker </concepts/contexts/worker>`.  When a worker has several roles, they are given the cumulative set of privileges from those contributed by each role.

Roles also determine the :doc:`plugins </concepts/plugins>` that workers are permitted to use.  This can be used to restrict individual plugins to specific groups.

Administrators are granted all privileges regardless of the roles you assign to them.
