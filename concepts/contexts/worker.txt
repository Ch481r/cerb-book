Worker
------

A **worker** is a person who represents your organization while performing their duties.  A worker with unrestricted privileges is called an **administrator**.

For example, workers may include:

- Accountants
- Contractors
- Customer service reps
- Developers
- Executives
- Financiers
- Investors
- Lawyers
- Marketers
- Partners
- Public officials
- Researchers
- Salespeople
- System administrators
- Volunteers

Fields
======

Workers have the following fields:

- **First Name**
    A given name.  This is used for snippets like signatures, as well as everywhere the worker is displayed in the user interface.

- **Last Name**
    A surname.  This is also used for snippets like signatures, and every time the worker is displayed in the user interface.

- **Title**
    A job title.  This is used in snippets like signatures.  For example:
        - Account representative
        - CTO
        - Customer Service
        - Designer
        - IT Supervisor

- **Email**
    An *personal* email address.  This will be used to identify the worker when logging in.  This address will also be the default method of contacting the worker or validating their identity -- for example, when resetting a lost password.  This **must not** be an email address that delivers to the helpdesk.

- **Password**
    The password used by the worker to log in.  This is not strictly required if you choose to enable an alternate authentication mechanism like LDAP or OpenID.

- **Is Administrator**
    *TRUE* if the worker is an administrator with all privileges, *FALSE* otherwise.

- **Is Disabled**
    *TRUE* if the worker's account is deactivated and their login is disabled, *FALSE* otherwise.  This is used to revoke all privileges while still preserving the history of a worker that is no longer a part of your team or organization.  Disabling a worker's account is generally preferable to deleting it.

- **Last Activity**
    The last activity performed by this worker.  This is displayed as part of the *Who's Online* functionality.

- **Last Activity Date**
    The last date and time that this worker interacted with the user interface.  This is used to determine idleness.

* **Last Activity IP**
    The most recent IP address used by this worker.  This is displayed as part of the *Who's Online* functionality.  It is also used for session security.
