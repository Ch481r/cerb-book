Group
-----

A **group** is a collection of :doc:`workers </concepts/contexts/worker>` who are considered to be interchangeable when a specific kind of task needs to be performed.  Groups are most effective when they are defined broadly.

For example, these groups reflect departments:

- Billing
- Corporate
- Development
- Legal
- Marketing
- Sales
- Support

.. note::
    
    You aren't required to associate your groups with departments.  You may create groups based on any combination of attributes: geography, language, product line, service level, etc.  This is easy to change and you can experiment to find an approach that works well for your particular environment.

A worker can be a **member** of multiple groups. Any number of members may also be designated as **managers**, which provides them with administrative control of the group.

Each group has an **inbox** that collects new work.  This makes it easy to distinguish fresh assignments from things that have already been seen.  Groups should strive to maintain an empty :term:`inbox` by continuously *doing*, *deferring*, or *delegating* work.  This is the same basic process that is encouraged by productivity workflows like *Getting Things Done* [#gtd]_.

Groups provide a way for tasks to be delegated to a *type* of worker, rather than an individual.  This is efficient, because a worker doesn't need to concern themselves with finding the most appropriate person to assign something to.  They also don't need to worry about the proper place to move it to.  Once work arrives in an inbox, the members of that group can determine exactly what to do with it.

**Buckets** are the primary method that groups use to organize their work.  A :term:`bucket` is a container for storing similar things together -- much like the purpose of sorting files into folders on your hard drive.  The advantage of buckets is that they're very simple for workers to understand and use.  The drawback is that buckets tend to describe a single characteristic (e.g. color) and they aren't very good at handling multi-dimensional work (e.g. color and size).  Groups that need to organize multi-dimensional data can use :doc:`workspaces </concepts/workspaces/index>`.
