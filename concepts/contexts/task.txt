Task
----

A **task** describes a single unit of work.

For example, the process that a software company follows when receiving a new order may involve these tasks:

#. Generate the software license.
#. Send the license to the client.
#. Send the purchase information to accounting.
#. Mark the client's invoice as paid.

A different :doc:`group </concepts/contexts/group>` or :doc:`worker </concepts/contexts/worker>` may be responsible for each task.  Some tasks will be *synchronous*, where the ability to start working on one task depends on the completion of one or all preceding tasks.  Tasks that are *asynchronous* can be worked on simultaneously.

Tasks are :doc:`linked </concepts/objects/connections>` to the :doc:`objects </concepts/objects/index>` that they relate to.

Fields
======
Tasks have the following fields:

- **Title**
    A summary of the task in a sentence.
    
- **Due Date**
    The latest date and time when this task should be completed by.
