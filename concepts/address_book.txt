Address Book
------------

-  A person who corresponds with the helpdesk is referred to as a
   **contact**. These are your customers, partners, and prospects. If
   you're part of the I.T. department for a large corporation, then
   contacts are likely your co-workers who ask questions and report
   problems.

-  The **address book** is a list of all the contacts in your helpdesk.
   It provides the ability to group contacts by various attributes (e.g.
   location, language, industry) to build customer lists and mailing
   lists.
