Customize
---------

Each :doc:`worker </concepts/contexts/worker>` can customize a :doc:`worklist </concepts/worklists/index>` to according to their own preferences.

The following properties of worklists can be customized:

- **Title**
    A descriptive name for the worklist that is shown at the top of it.  This can be modified on custom worklists, but not on built-in worklists.  If you're adding required filters, it is a good idea to describe them clearly in the title as well.  For example: **Conversations waiting for reply more than 30 days**

- **Columns**
    The object :doc:`fields </concepts/objects/fields>` to be displayed as horizontal columns.  These can be added, removed, and reordered.  :doc:`Custom fields </concepts/objects/custom_fields>` can also be added as worklist columns.

- **Rows Per Page**
    The number of rows to display per :doc:`page </concepts/worklists/paging>`.  You might want to display a lot of rows if you have a large monitor, or you could display a small number of rows to fit more worklists on the screen at the same time. 

- **Required Filters**
    The hidden :doc:`filters </concepts/worklists/filters>` that will always be enforced on this worklist.  Additional filtering can only return a number of results less than or equal to the number of results that satisfy the required filters.  For example, a :doc:`ticket </concepts/contexts/ticket>` worklist might require that its results have a status of *open* or *waiting for reply*.  A worker could further reduce these results by filtering for only the *waiting* tickets in that list.  Filtering for *closed* tickets, instead, would return zero results.  This is because a ticket can't be (*open* **OR** *waiting*) **AND** *closed*.  The use of boolean logic is explained in more detail in the section about :doc:`worklist filters </concepts/worklists/filters>`.
