Export
------

:doc:`Worklists </concepts/worklists/index>` can **export** data about their :doc:`objects </concepts/objects/index>` in multiple formats.  This is used to synchronize data from Cerb5 to other applications and services.

For example, you can create targeted mailing lists from :doc:`filtered </concepts/worklists/filters>` address worklists.  These mailing lists could then be imported into almost any email marketing program.

You can also use export functionality to copy contacts and organizations between two copies of Cerb5, or to quickly create many :doc:`opportunities </concepts/contexts/opportunity>` for a new sales campaign.
