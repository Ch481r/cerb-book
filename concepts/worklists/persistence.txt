Persistence
-----------

The changes that each :doc:`worker </concepts/contexts/worker>` makes to a :doc:`worklist </concepts/worklists/index>` are automatically **persisted**.  Once a worker tweaks their worklists the way they want them, their environment will look the same way every time they log in.

The persisted properties of worklists include:

- :doc:`Visible columns </concepts/worklists/customize>`
- :doc:`Current page </concepts/worklists/paging>`
- :doc:`Editable filters </concepts/worklists/filters>`
- :doc:`Subtotals </concepts/worklists/subtotals>`
