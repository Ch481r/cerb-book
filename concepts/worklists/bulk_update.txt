Bulk Update
-----------

**Bulk update** performs several actions at once to :doc:`objects </concepts/objects/index>` in a :doc:`worklist </concepts/worklists/index>`.

A bulk update can be applied to:

- **The whole list**
    Actions will be performed to every object on every :doc:`page </concepts/worklists/paging>` of the worklist.

- **Only checked objects**
    Actions will be performed on the selected objects on the current :doc:`page </concepts/worklists/paging>` of the worklist.

- **Random objects**
    Actions will be performed on a specific number of random objects drawn from all :doc:`pages </concepts/worklists/paging>`.  This is useful for A/B testing [#ab_testing]_, or for making randomly distributed assignments from large lists of available work.
