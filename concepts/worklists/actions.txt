Actions
-------

Beneath each :doc:`worklist </concepts/worklists/index>` is a toolbar of possible **actions** that can be performed on the selected objects of the current :doc:`page </concepts/worklists/paging>`. Two of the common actions that are available across most worklists are :doc:`explore </concepts/worklists/explore>` and :doc:`bulk update </concepts/worklists/bulk_update>`.
