The sorting options displayed at the top of the piles section allow you to group by :guilabel:`Subject`, :guilabel:`Senders`, or :guilabel:`Headers`. Selecting :guilabel:`Headers` will display an input box allowing you to enter a custom header, and a few common filters have been provided as links below the input box for convenience.
