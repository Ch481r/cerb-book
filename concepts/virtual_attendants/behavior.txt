Behavior
--------

A **behavior** is a set of linked :term:`decisions <decision>` that determine how to react to
an event.

Examples:

-  If new mail is received during the weekend, and the sender has a paid
   support plan, then relay the message to a list of worker mobile email
   addresses.
-  When new mail is delivered to the Inbox, and it has a high
   probability of being spam, then move it to the "Spam" bucket.
-  If a new order is received, send an SMS message to a list of worker
   mobile phones.
-  If it's Friday, then decide if it's before or after 6pm. If before
   6pm, do nothing. If after 6pm, send an automatic reply to the
   recipients that we've left the office for the weekend but will return
   at 8am on Monday, and give them emergency contact information.
-  If a new message has the subject "send me a price list", then reply
   with a pre-defined message detailing the current prices.
-  If a new message has the subject "unsubscribe", then set the "Do not
   contact" custom field on the sender address to "yes" and move the
   message to the "Cancels" bucket.
