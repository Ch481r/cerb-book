Virtual Attendants
------------------

**Virtual Attendants** (VAs) are automated workers.  You can think of them as robotic personal assistants that handle repetitive tasks for you.  Every worker and group has their own Virtual Attendant.  VAs are capable of making complex decisions based on the details of a given situation.

Virtual Attendants can perform almost any action that a worker can.  For example, they can:

- Read and write email
- Create tasks
- Modify object properties and custom fields
- Add comments
- Generate arbitrary notifications
- Make assignments
- Send time-sensitive reminders
- Establish links between objects

Virtual Attendants endow *any* worker with the ability to automate repetitive tasks and enforce desirable behavior.  Unlike the creation of :term:`plugins <plugin>`, VAs can be mastered without any computer programming experience.

Understanding how Virtual Attendants work will give you an incredibly powerful tool that can be applied to countless situations. For example, VAs can be used to:

- Send automated replies that utilize personal information about the contact, their organization, and history
- Generate notifications in response to specific kinds of email (e.g. orders)
- Quarantine spam
- Set due dates based on an organization's service-level agreement
- Distribute assignments to workers based on complex criteria (e.g. skills, schedule, availability)
- Organize incoming work into buckets
- Relay important messages to workers' mobile phones
- Create a reminder to follow up with a client at a future date
- Schedule a series of tasks to be followed as a checklist
- Escalate assignments to ensure response time guarantees are met

Virtual Attendants can also provide quick access to shortcuts.  A worker can instruct their VA to repeat a frequently used sequence of actions with a single click.

One of the most powerful aspects of Attendants is that you aren't limited to our built-in conditions and actions. Through plugins, VAs can even send SMS text messages to workers' mobile phones, or write messages to instant messengers and chat rooms. While we've tried to eliminate the requirement of plugins for automation, combining plugins and Virtual Attendants will allow you to automate almost anything.

Virtual Attendants are given instructions by creating custom **behavior** on various **events**.  This behavior is comprised of **decisions**, **outcomes**, and **actions**. More information can be found in the pages below.
