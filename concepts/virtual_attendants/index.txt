Virtual Attendants
------------------

    :maxdepth: 2

The goal in the design of Virtual Attendants was to provide a way for
workers and group managers to automate various workflows without having
to create custom plugins. Workers can now automate sophisticated
business logic from their browser without any knowledge of programming
software.

This may sound complicated, but taking the time to understand how
Virtual Attendants work will give you some incredibly powerful tools to
apply to countless situations. For example:

-  Generating notifications in response to specific kinds of email
-  Setting due dates based on the sender's service level agreement (SLA)
-  Sending auto-replies
-  Quarantining spam
-  Assigning incoming tickets to workers based on various criteria
-  Organizing incoming work into buckets
-  Relaying messages to workers' mobile phones

Virtual Attendants can even create tasks, write comments, automatically
reply to customers, and set custom field values. One of the most
powerful aspects of Attendants is that you aren't limited to our
built-in conditions and actions. Through plugins, Attendants can even
send SMS text messages to workers' mobile phones, or write messages to
instant messengers and chat rooms. While we've tried to eliminate the
requirement of plugins for automation, combining plugins and Virtual
Attendants will allow you to automate almost any kind of behavior.

Virtual Attendants monitor specific *events* and react with pre-defined
*behavior*. Each *decision* chooses the best *outcome* and runs the
associated *actions*.

Events
~~~~~~

An *event* is triggered when something noteworthy occurs.

Examples:

-  A customer replies to a conversation.
-  A worker replies to a customer.
-  A conversation is moved to a new bucket.
-  A conversation is marked closed.

Behavior
~~~~~~~~

A *behavior* is a set of linked decisions that determine how to react to
an event.

Examples:

-  If new mail is received during the weekend, and the sender has a paid
   support plan, then relay the message to a list of worker mobile email
   addresses.
-  When new mail is delivered to the Inbox, and it has a high
   probability of being spam, then move it to the "Spam" bucket.
-  If a new order is received, send an SMS message to a list of worker
   mobile phones.
-  If it's Friday, then decide if it's before or after 6pm. If before
   6pm, do nothing. If after 6pm, send an automatic reply to the
   recipients that we've left the office for the weekend but will return
   at 8am on Monday, and give them emergency contact information.
-  If a new message has the subject "send me a price list", then reply
   with a pre-defined message detailing the current prices.
-  If a new message has the subject "unsubscribe", then set the "Do not
   contact" custom field on the sender address to "yes" and move the
   message to the "Cancels" bucket.

Decisions
~~~~~~~~~

A *decision* chooses the best outcome from several possible choices. The
result of a decision can be a series of actions, or another decision; or
both.

Examples:

-  Is today either Monday or Friday?
-  Is it after 8am and before 6pm?
-  Is this conversation in the Inbox bucket?
-  Does the sender's organization have 'Software' checked in the
   'Industries' custom field?

Conditions
~~~~~~~~~~

A *condition* is the comparison of a single property to one or more
values using an operator. There are many possible operators depending on
the type of field: equals, doesn't equal, contains phrase, is greater
than, is any of, etc. The result of a condition will always be either or
.

Examples:

-  "Time of Day" [is not] before 8am
-  "Day of Week" [is any of] Saturday or Sunday
-  "Message Subject" [starts with] "Receipt"

Outcomes
~~~~~~~~

The first *outcome* to pass all of its conditions is selected by the
decision. The final outcome in a list of choices can have zero
conditions in order to catch every other outcome. If no outcomes match
the behavior is terminated.

Examples:

-  Decision: What day of week is it?
-  Outcome #1: Friday, Saturday, or Sunday
-  Outcome #2: Anything else
-  Decision: What time of day is it?
-  Outcome #1: Before 8am
-  Outcome #2: Before 6pm
-  Outcome #3: After 6pm
-  Decision: What bucket is the conversation in?
-  Outcome #1: Inbox
-  Decision: Does the sender's first name begin with "J"?
-  Outcome #1: Yes
-  Outcome #2: No
-  Decision: What is the value of the service level custom field on
   sender's organization?
-  Outcome #1: V.I.P.
-  Outcome #2: Paid support
-  Outcome #3: Anything else (Regular support)

Actions
~~~~~~~

An *action* defines a set of things to do.

Examples:

-  Write a comment with the text "Automatically added to billing."
-  Create task with the title "Follow-up in 3 days" and add a list of
   workers as watchers.
-  Send a reply to the recipients using a template with placeholders for
   first name and company name.
-  Close the conversation.
-  Send an SMS message to a list of mobile phones.
