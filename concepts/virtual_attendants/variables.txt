Variables
---------

A **variable** allows you to capture data when a Virtual Attendant runs.  Variables can contain almost anything, and that data can then be used in :term:`outcomes <outcome>` and :term:`actions <action>`.

Examples:

- Capture a list of workers based on Calendar Availability.
- Set a date variable based on the last time someone wrote in.
- Set a boolean variable based on several different factors to use in an email template.
- Set a worker variable based on a list of workers, groups, and other criteria.
