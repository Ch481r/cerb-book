A **decision** chooses the best :term:`outcome` from several possible choices. The result of a :term:`decision` can be a series of :term:`actions <action>` and/or another decision.

Examples:

-  Is today either Monday or Friday?
-  Is it after 8am and before 6pm?
-  Is this conversation in the Inbox bucket?
-  Does the sender's organization have 'Software' checked in the
   'Industries' custom field?
