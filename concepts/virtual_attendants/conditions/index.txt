Conditions
----------

A **condition** is the comparison of a single property to one or more values using an operator. There are many possible operators depending on the type of field: equals, doesn't equal, contains phrase, is greater than, is any of, etc. The result of a condition will always be either `true` or `false`.

Examples:

-  "Time of Day" [is not] before 8am
-  "Day of Week" [is any of] Saturday or Sunday
-  "Message Subject" [starts with] "Receipt"
