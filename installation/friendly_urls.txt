   This URL isn't very pretty.

You may notice that your URLs look a bit ugly with the omnipresent
``/index.php/`` in the path. Cerb can use *URL rewriting* to make URLs
shorter and more user-friendly, but this requires webserver support.

Enabling friendly URLs with Apache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're using the Apache web server you can enable *"friendly URLs"*
with the following commands:

::

    $ cd /path/to/cerb6
    $ cp .htaccess-dist .htaccess

For this to work you will need ``mod_rewrite`` to be enabled in your
Apache configuration. This is usually the case, unless you have just
compiling or installed it.

If ``mod_rewrite`` isn't enabled, you can enable it with the following
command on many Linux-based servers:

::

    $ sudo a2enmod rewrite
    $ /etc/init.d/apache2 reload

Enabling friendly URLs with nginx
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`nginx <http://wiki.nginx.org/>`_ is another popular lightweight
webserver for serving PHP content. It doesn't support the Apache
``.htaccess`` file format, but you can add the following directives to
your server configuration to get the same effect:

::

    location / {
        if (!-e $request_filename) { 
            rewrite ^/(.+)$ /index.php/$1 last;
        }
    }
    location ~ ^(.+.php)(.*)$ {
        fastcgi_split_path_info ^(.+.php)(.*)$;
        fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
        fastcgi_index  index.php;
        fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME  /var/www$fastcgi_script_name;
        fastcgi_param  PATH_INFO        $fastcgi_path_info;
        include fastcgi_params;
        fastcgi_param  QUERY_STRING     $query_string;
        fastcgi_param  REQUEST_METHOD   $request_method;
        fastcgi_param  CONTENT_TYPE     $content_type;
        fastcgi_param  CONTENT_LENGTH   $content_length;
        fastcgi_intercept_errors        on;
        fastcgi_ignore_client_abort     off;
        fastcgi_connect_timeout 60;
        fastcgi_send_timeout 180;
        fastcgi_read_timeout 180;
        fastcgi_buffer_size 128k;
        fastcgi_buffers 4 256k;
        fastcgi_busy_buffers_size 256k;
        fastcgi_temp_file_write_size 256k;
    }

This assumes that Cerb6 is installed in the root of the webserver.
Otherwise, just prepend the path in your configuration. You also will
want to create a blank ``.htaccess`` file so Cerb will automatically
generate friendly URLs for you.
