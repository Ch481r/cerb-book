   This URL isn't very pretty.

You may notice that your URLs look a bit ugly with the omnipresent
``/index.php/`` in the path. Cerb can use *URL rewriting* to make URLs
shorter and more user-friendly, but this requires webserver support.

   This looks much nicer with friendly URLs enabled!

Enabling friendly URLs with Apache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're using the Apache web server you can enable *"friendly URLs"*
with the following commands:

::

    $ cd /path/to/cerb
    $ cp .htaccess-dist .htaccess

For this to work you will need ``mod_rewrite`` to be enabled in your
Apache configuration. This is usually the case, unless you have just
compiling or installed it.

If ``mod_rewrite`` isn't enabled, you can enable it with the following
command on many Linux-based servers:

::

    $ sudo a2enmod rewrite
    $ /etc/init.d/apache2 reload

Enabling friendly URLs with nginx
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See: :ref:`Configuring Nginx for friendly URLs <nginx_vhost_config>`

.. note::

    You should create a blank :file:`.htaccess` file in your :file:`/cerb` directory to enable URL rewriting with non-Apache webservers.
