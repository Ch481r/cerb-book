Installing Cerb on your server
------------------------------

The following general instructions assume that you have console access to a Linux-based server and that it meets the :doc:`server requirements </installation/requirements/index>`.  You should already have the webserver, database, and PHP installed before proceeding.

Specialized guides
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider using one of these comprehensive installation guides instead:

* :doc:`/cookbook/installation/ubuntu_nginx_phpfpm`
* :doc:`/cookbook/installation/windows_server_2008_iis7_php`

Download the files from GitHub using Git
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, change directory to your website's document directory. The directory will usually be named something like :file:`htdocs`, :file:`httpdocs`, :file:`public_html`, or :file:`www`, and it will be located in the directory of the appropriate website.

::

    $ cd /path/to/example.com/httpdocs

When deploying Cerb on a production server you should use :program:`Git` to manage the project files. Git provides many useful capabilities:

* You can quickly upgrade by just fetching files that have changed since your last update.
* You can see the local changes that you have made to any project files.
* You can easily reset files back to their default condition.
* You can see what changes *would* occur before performing an upgrade.
* You can continuously merge your local changes with our future updates.

You won't need to download the entire project again after your initial installation. You also won't have to hassle with copying your :file:`framework.config.php` configuration file or storage directory when upgrading, or repeating any of your custom modifications to the source code.

You can download the project files using Git with a single command::

    $ git clone git://github.com/wgm/cerb6.git cerb

Set permissions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, we want to make sure the Cerb files are owned by the proper user and group on the webserver.  The default user and group are both ``www-data`` when using Ubuntu.  If you're using something else, you should consult your configuration for the proper values.

You only need to enable write access in two locations:

-  :file:`framework.config.php` 
    This is your configuration file.
-  :file:`storage/`
    This is where any data unique to your installation is stored: third-party plugins, attachments, temporary files, caches, etc.

Give ownership of all the files to the webserver daemon using :program:`chown`, and make the two locations above writable using :program:`chmod`::

    $ cd cerb
    $ chown -R www-data:www-data .
    $ chmod -R u+w framework.config.php storage

.. note::

    You will need to use your own user and group information instead of ``www-data``.  If you're not sure what this should be, and you're using Apache, you can check your configuration with the following command::
    
    $ grep -e "^User" -e "^Group" /path/to/httpd.conf

    There are also special situations, such as when running :term:`PHP` in FastCGI mode, or installing security extensions like :program:`Suhosin`, where the ownership and permissions of the files might need to be something else.  Consult a system administrator if you need assistance.  The Cerb installer will let you know if the permissions are set incorrectly.

Create the database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a new :program:`MySQL` database using the console or your favorite GUI.

From the MySQL console, you can issue the following SQL statements::

    mysql> CREATE DATABASE cerb6 CHARACTER SET utf8;
    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON cerb.*  
            TO cerb@localhost 
            IDENTIFIED BY 'secret_password';

.. note:: 

    Substitute your own database name and login in place of ``cerb``, and replace ``secret_password`` with something that's actually a secret.

If you're concerned about granting ``ALL PRIVILEGES``, the minimum required privileges for the database user are:

-  ``SELECT``
-  ``INSERT``
-  ``UPDATE``
-  ``DELETE``
-  ``CREATE``
-  ``ALTER``
-  ``DROP``
-  ``CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES``
