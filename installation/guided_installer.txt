Running the guided installer
----------------------------

Cerb comes with a guided installer that helps you configure the system.

To start the installer, point your browser to: ``http://www.example.com/cerb6/install``

.. note:: 

    You will need to replace :file:`www.example.com` in the URL with your actual domain name.  If you installed Cerb in a path other than :file:`/cerb6` then you will need to change that too.

The server environment checker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The installer will determine if your server meets the requirements for installing Cerb. Correct any problems before proceeding, and then click the :guilabel:`Next Step` button.

Accept the software license
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Click the :guilabel:`I Accept` button if you agree to the :doc:`licensing terms </license>`.

Configure the database connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /images/installation/installer_step3_database.gif
   :alt: Adding database connection details.
   :figclass: bordered

Add your database connection details:

**Driver** 
    If you have the ability to use the ``MySQLi`` driver then you should select it. It's newer than the standard ``MySQL`` driver. Otherwise, use the default.
**Engine**
    ``MyISAM`` and ``InnoDB`` both have advantages and disadvantages. Your choice will impact performance and various processes like backups. If you are unsure about the tradeoffs, use ``MyISAM``. If you are familiar with ``InnoDB`` then you may experience better performance under high loads with that engine. This decision isn't permanent; you can switch database engines later.
**Host**
    This is the hostname of your database server. If it's on the same machine as your webserver you can enter ``localhost`` to use sockets rather than TCP/IP connections (which are faster). Otherwise, enter a hostname or IP address.
**Database Name**
    Enter the name of the new database you created.
**Username**
    Enter the username from your MySQL ``GRANT PRIVILEGES`` command.
**Password**
    Enter the password from your MySQL ``GRANT PRIVILEGES`` command.

Once you have entered your database details, click the :guilabel:`Test Settings` button to verify the software can connect to your database.

If successful, the installer will create your initial database structure. This may take a few moments because the database is created by incrementally running the updates from each previous version; so don't worry if it doesn't look like anything is happening right away.

Configure general settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: /images/installation/installer_step6_settings.gif
   :alt: Personalizing your helpdesk.
   :figclass: bordered

In this step you'll configure a few global settings:

**Website Title**
    This is the text shown at the top of the browser, or on each browser tab, that makes it easy to distinguish Cerb from other web pages.
**Default Sender**
    This is the email address that Cerb will use as the :mailheader:`From:` address on outgoing mail that can't be attributed to a particular group. It is very important that this email address delivers mail to your helpdesk. In many cases you will want to use an email address like ``support@example.com``.
**Default Sender Name**
    This is the personalized name that will display next to the :mailheader:`From:` address in your customers' inboxes.
    
    For example::
    
        From: "WebGroup Media LLC" <support@webgroupmedia.com>

Click the :guilabel:`Continue` button when you've finished entering your preferences.

Configure outgoing mail (SMTP)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :alt: Configuring outgoing mail.
   :figclass: bordered

Cerb won't be very useful if it can't send mail to your contacts.  In this step, we'll configure your outgoing mail server.

**SMTP Server**
    This is your SMTP mail server. If your mail server is located on the same machine as your webserver then you can enter ``localhost``. Otherwise this should be a hostname or IP address that your webserver is authorized to relay through. This is most often a corporate mail server or `Google Apps <https://www.google.com/a/>`_.
**SMTP Port**
    This is the port where your SMTP server is listening for mail. If you aren't sure what port to use, check with your server administrator.
    
    Here are some defaults:

    - **SMTP:** ``25``
    - **SMTP-TLS:** ``587``
    - **SMTP-SSL:** ``465``
    - If you're using Google Apps, instructions can be found at:  
      <http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=13287>
      
**SMTP Auth User**
    If your SMTP server requires authorization then enter your username here.
    
**SMTP Auth Password**
    This is only required if your SMTP server is using authentication.
    
**SMTP Encryption**

    The following encryption options are available:

    - **TLS:** Mail will be sent over a transport layer security (`TLS <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security>`_) connection.
    - **SSL:** Mail will be sent over an secure socket layer (`SSL <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSL>`_) connection.
    - **None:** Encryption is disabled.

Click the :guilabel:`Test Outgoing Mail` button to verify your settings.

Create your account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :alt: Creating your account.
   :figclass: bordered

Now the installer will prompt you to create an administrator account that you will use to log in. Use a personal email address that you check, but not something that will route back to the application. Cerb will use this email address to contact you in the future (for example, if you forget your password).

Choose a password and then click the :guilabel:`Continue` button.

Register
~~~~~~~~

In the final step of the installer you are given the opportunity to introduce yourself to the Cerb development team in exchange for a *free* 3 seat (simultaneous workers) license to help you get started. There are no strings attached. This free license provides full functionality, with no expiration, but it does not include future updates. We hope that you find the software useful, and we're looking forward to growing along with you.

If you choose not to register your copy of Cerb then the software will default to *Free Mode* which is limited to a single seat but has no other restrictions.

Complete the short survey in exchange for your free license and then click the :guilabel:`Register` button.

Finish up!

You're almost ready to start using Cerb6.

.. warning::

    If this is a production installation, you should delete the :file:`install` directory since it is no longer necessary and it provides access to some sensitive information (specifically, the ``phpinfo()`` output that describes your webserver environment). If you're planning to use language packs for localization, be sure to copy the :file:`install/extras/translations/*` files to another location.

.. note::

    If this is a development installation, then you should leave the :file:`install` directory intact since it contains many useful scripts, as well as examples for plugin development.

Once you're ready to log in, click the :guilabel:`Take me there!` link.
