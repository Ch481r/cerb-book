Configuring group mail preferences

   Setting group mail preferences.

You have one option in your group's mail preferences -- whether or not a
reference number should be displayed in the subject line of your email
responses. There are some considerations for both users and technology.

For users, a reference number makes it easy to refer to the details of a
particular conversation at a later date, in any channel. For example, a
user may decide to follow-up their original email through a live-help
chat, IM, Twitter, Facebook, or phone conversation. In public channels,
a reference number like "ABC-12345-678" is far more anonymous than
providing a name, company, or email address. In private channels, like a
phone call, it's probably easier to just ask a customer for their email
address when retrieving their conversation history.

From a technical standpoint, the reference number was used in earlier
versions of Cerb5 to associate a reply with the message it was replying
to. When someone replies to a message sent from Cerb5, the headers are
checked first, and then the subject line is scanned for a reference
number as a last resort. This is not necessary with most modern email
applications. Incoming messages can be associated with the message they
are replying to using the ``In-Reply-To:`` and ``References:`` headers
from the RFC-2822 standard. Unsurprisingly, Microsoft chose to implement
their own proprietary headers in Exchange and Outlook (``Thread-Topic:``
and ``Thread-Index:``), but the proper ``In-Reply-To:`` header should
still be added by Exchange when mail originated from outside a sender's
organization. However, it's not uncommon to encounter users with
misconfigured Exchange servers.

Ultimately, the decision to display a reference number on the subject
line is entirely subjective. If you find it useful then you can enable
the feature. Otherwise, there is no penalty to having your outgoing mail
look more personal with a subject line that simply reads *"Re: That
stuff you asked about."*

With reference numbers enabled, your recipients will receive replies
with a subject like:

    Re: [Support #ABC-98765-123]: My printer seems to vaporize paper.

When reference numbers are disabled, the subject of your replies is
provided in the traditional format:

    Re: My printer seems to vaporize paper.

Creating buckets to organize work
---------------------------------

*Buckets* are flexible containers used by groups to organize their
workload. Work can queue up in buckets, making it more efficient to
handle similar issues at the same time (e.g. processing orders, issuing
refunds, sending out beta information). Buckets are also useful to move
piles of work out of the way if they shouldn't be handled immediately
(e.g. newsletters, survey responses, feature requests).

With department-themed groups your buckets might look like:

-  **Billing:** receipts, refunds
-  **Corporate:** execs, partners, biz-dev
-  **Development:** bugs, feature requests, feedback
-  **I.T.:** logs, alerts, abuse
-  **Marketing:** surveys, newsletters
-  **Sales:** leads
-  **Support:** technical, account issues

Or if you had product-related groups you might do the following:

-  **Product X:** Orders, Refunds, Support
-  **Product Y:** Orders, Refunds, Support
-  **Product Z:** Orders, Refunds, Support

Since buckets are often only concerned with a single shared
characteristic they aren't always the best way to organize work. They
provide a simple building block for more complex workflows.

To add new buckets, select the *Buckets* tab, and click the *Add*
button. Enter the following information:

   Creating a new bucket.

-  **Name:** This is the name of the bucket. For example: receipts,
   leads, newsletters, etc.

-  **Send replies as email:** This specifies an email address to use as
   the sender in ``From:``. This will default to the sender address on
   the group's inbox.

-  **Send replies as name:** This allows you to provide a personal name
   that will display next to the sender address when your recipient
   reads their email. For example, ``billing@example.com`` may use the
   personal name *"Widget Factory - Billing Dept."*. This gives the
   recipient an idea of who you are; especially if they don't recognize
   your email address. This will default to sender name on the group's
   inbox.

-  **Bucket email signature:** This defines the worker signature that
   will be used when mail is sent from this bucket. You can use
   placeholders like the current worker's name or title, which will
   automatically fill in the appropriate values depending on who is
   sending the email. This will default to the signature on the group's
   inbox. You can also use conditional logic and modifiers in this
   template. Refer to the section about Snippets for more information.

-  **Workflow:** If you check this box then the bucket will be hidden
   from the *Workflow* tab on the Mail page.

When you're finished, click the *Save Changes* button.

Configuring group buckets for workflow
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For workflow purposes, buckets can be designated as *assignable*
(visible) or *non-assignable* (hidden).

**Assignable buckets** contain work that is actionable -- that is, the
work should be assigned and handled in a relatively quick timeframe in
an effort to keep the bucket empty and the recipients happy. Some
examples of assignable work include:

-  New orders
-  Payment receipts
-  Sales inquiries
-  Requests for help
-  Partnership requests

**Non-assignable buckets** contain work that doesn't need immediate
attention and would otherwise detract from the goal of having empty
buckets and quick handling of actionable work. Non-assignable work is
usually queued up until a future point and then handled in bulk. Some
examples of non-assignable work include:

-  Automatically quarantined spam
-  Bounces (return to sender)
-  Logged events sent to email
-  Long-running promotions that will be processed at a future date
-  Vendor newsletters

Given these definitions, you should hide your spam quarantine buckets
from the Workflow view, making it easier to focus on actionable work.

Organizing group buckets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A group's inbox is always the top bucket in the list. You can drag
custom buckets into a new desired order. It's a good idea to move the
default *Spam* bucket to the bottom of the list so it's out of the way.

Configuring the group Virtual Attendant
---------------------------------------

Each group has a Virtual Attendant that provides a way for you to
automate workflow and business logic. If necessary, you can review the
topic of `Virtual Attendants <#virtual-attendants>`_ in the
`Concepts <#concepts>`_ chapter.

Group Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  **Conversation closed in group** - This event occurs when a ticket
   set to the closed status. You can use this for behavior like sending
   an email to the customer asking if their issues were solved to their
   satisfaction (using satisfaction surveys, etc).
-  **Conversation moved in group** - This event occurs when a ticket is
   moved into the group from another group, or when it's moved to a new
   bucket within the group. For example, this can be used to
   automatically sort mail that lands in the inbox into buckets.
-  **New message on a group conversation** - This event occurs when a
   new email message is sent or received by a group conversation. This
   can be used to send notifications to workers or confirmations to
   customers. This event can also be used to automatically assign
   workers as watchers to specific kinds of messages: new orders,
   receipts, mail from V.I.P. senders, etc.

Example: Sending an automated message to new group conversations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It's fairly common for a group to want to send an automated
acknowledgement when new conversations are started.

1. Manage your group.
2. Click the *Virtual Attendant* tab.
3. Under *Create New Behavior* choose "New message on a group
   conversation"

As a group manager you can add or remove members. You can also promote
