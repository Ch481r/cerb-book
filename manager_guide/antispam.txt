Anti-Spam Filtering
-------------------

**Important Note:** Until you've handled a few hundred messages, the
anti-spam system will probably come to some seemingly bizarre
conclusions based on little evidence that messages are *"spammy"*. This
is part of the training process. It's important to spend a few minutes
each day reviewing the spam filtering decisions that were automatically
made for you. Cerb5 will learn when you make corrections, and it will be
far less likely to make the same mistakes in the future. Our helpdesk at
WebGroup Media has been trained for several years, and it's rare to see
a single *false positive* in 10,000 messages quarantined as spam.

How it works: in plain English
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Cerb5 employs a **Bayesian filtering algorithm**  [1]_ to combat spam.

This filtering tactic is useful because it's highly adaptable; it learns
to recognize spam based on a studious analysis of the patterns of
content found in your typical daily mail. For example, a pharmacy's
helpdesk may receive mail that mentions words like *"pills"* and
*"prescription"* on a daily basis, and Cerb5 won't considered these
messages to be spam because those terms are familiar to the health care
industry. However, to the rest of us they're very suspicious words to
find in our inbox. Likewise, messages from unknown contacts that mention
both *"Java"* and *"programming"* have a much higher probability of
being junk mail when sent to a pharmaceutical company compared to a
software development company.

How it works: a technical explanation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  Anti-spam is only triggered for the *first* message on a new ticket.
-  All text is converted to lowercase.
-  Accent marks are removed from characters (e.g. *ü* to *u*, *é* to
   *e*). Even though Cerb5 supports European languages, accent marks are
   found in many spam messages attempting to disguise English words.
   Accented letters also dramatically increase the number of possible
   word combinations, which slows down the process on busy helpdesks.
-  Punctuation is removed and repeated whitespace between words is
   reduced to a single space.
-  Duplicate words are removed.
-  Common *stop words* are removed from the text (e.g. *the*, *that*,
   *which*). These words are present in almost every email and therefore
   aren't very useful for making filtering decisions.
-  The remaining words are filtered to be between ``3`` and ``24``
   characters in length. This is a performance tweak that helps keep the
   database manageable.

Once Cerb5 has reduced an email to a list of unique, *less-than-common*
words it sorts the words by *interestingness*. Words are considered
interesting by being either very innocent (*"Cerberus"*) or very
suspicious (*"pills"*) on a scale of ``0.0001`` to ``0.9999``. The most
interesting words are used to calculate a spam score, based on how the
content of those messages was perceived by helpdesk workers in the past.
Words are more interesting as they deviate in either direction from a
``0.5000`` median (the median being where a word shows up as often in
spam as in non-spam and cancels itself out).

Configuring anti-spam functionality for groups
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main goal of Cerb5's anti-spam functionality is to quarantine
suspicious messages so they don't show up as active tickets in your
worklists. Companies vary in their anti-spam processes -- from deleting
suspicious mail immediately, to quarantining and reviewing -- and we
don't want to force people to adopt an arbitrary *"the one true way"*
process. The downside of this philosophy is that it's not obvious at
first how to best configure anti-spam functionality.

While the ideal process will depend on your own particular environment
and preferences, the following steps are recommended to all new helpdesk
managers.

The first step in filtering spam is configuring the behavior of your
groups:

   Configuring a group to quarantine probable spam.

-  Configure each group to filter probable spam (``>=85%``) into a
   bucket called *Spam*.
-  While it may seem more efficient to have a single *Spam* bucket
   shared between all your groups, we've found that most people should
   create a bucket for each group for these reasons:

   -  A *Spam* bucket per group allows you to quickly tell where
      messages lived before they were considered spam.
   -  It's easier to delegate spam review to workers for their own
      respective groups.
   -  A bucket per group still respects your group rosters. If you have
      a private group, you don't want any false positives (legitimate
      mail accidentally marked as spam) to become readable by everyone
      simply because it lands in a global *Spam* bucket.

Best practices for spam prevention in Cerb5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   :alt: Workers should always use the 'Report Spam' button

   Workers should always use the 'Report Spam' button

We've designed training to happen naturally based on a worker's actions
throughout the helpdesk:

-  It's important for workers to use the *Report Spam* button rather
   than just deleting junk mail. Deleting mail doesn't teach the system
   to be suspicious of similar mail in the future.
-  Workers should never mark spam as *Closed* or it will accumulate as
   clutter in the database. Ultimately this impacts performance, bloats
   backups, makes searches take longer, wastes system resources, etc.
-  A ticket is automatically trained as *Not Spam* when it's replied to
   by a worker. This means in most cases a worker should never have to
   instruct the system when a message isn't junk; it happens
   automatically.
-  Tickets that match explicit group filtering rules are automatically
   trained as *Not Spam*. This helps catch newsletters, receipts, and
   other read-only tickets your workers may never need to reply to.

Because the goal of spam filtering is to prevent workers from wasting
their valuable time looking at junk mail, it's not enough to just report
mail as spam. You should also hide spam from worklists. To do so,
navigate to the *Workflow* tab for each group and uncheck the
*Assignable* checkbox for each *Spam* bucket. This will hide their
contents from the totals on the *Workflow* list on the *Mail* page.

Hiding the spam buckets is also important because it allows workers to
accomplish the goal of having zero active tickets. Otherwise, a *Spam*
bucket in the *Sales* group with 20 messages will always show a *Sales*
group total of more than 20.

Why doesn't Cerb5 just "whitelist" address book contacts?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Whitelisting** is the process of ignoring a particular set of rules
for trusted entities.

We're often asked why Cerb5 doesn't whitelist contacts from the address
book and never consider their messages as spam. The problem with that
approach is how easy it is for spammers to forge (*"spoof"*) the sender
on email they're sending you. It's not uncommon to receive a lot of spam
*from* your own email addresses.

By not automatically whitelisting address book senders, Cerb5 has a
chance to filter out spoofed mail as well -- and that's mail that would
otherwise create thousands of junk messages that you would have to
manually clean up.

Purging quarantined spam
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The spam buckets should only be cleared once per day. It's inefficient
for workers to have to manage the spam buckets every time they
quarantine something. Each group should elect members to review and
empty the spam bucket. This helps make sure that a legitimate message
that has been mistakenly flagged as spam (as rare as that may be) isn't
ignored for too long.

   There are usually too many messages in a Spam bucket to audit them all individually.

We don't expect your workers to read every single quarantined message in
the *Spam* bucket, since most of the time everything is going to be
junk. Here's our process for rescuing legitimate mail from an
overflowing spam bucket while quickly purging the rest:

-  Create a new workspace with a worklist that shows only the *Spam*
   buckets of the groups you're responsible for.

-  Click the *customize* link on the worklist.

   -  Add the *# Nonspam* filter to the worklist.
   -  Set the number of rows to ``100`` (or whatever you find
      comfortable to read).

-  Click the *piles* link on the worklist, select *senders* and click
   the red *X* icon to delete anything that's obviously forged (e.g.
   junk mail sent to the helpdesk from your own email addresses). This
   process is quicker if you can delete mail sent from an entire domain
   (in our case: ``webgroupmedia.com``). You don't have to spend too
   long on this step, it just helps quickly reduce the amount of mail
   you're auditing.

-  Sort the *# Nonspam* column in the worklist in descending order by
   clicking on the column header until the icon is an arrow pointing
   downward.

-  Quickly scan through the remaining subjects in the list until the *#
   Nonspam* count is ``0``. Use *(peek)* on any ambiguous tickets to
   check their content. Rescue anything legitimate (which should usually
   be nothing) by selecting the row in the worklist and clicking the
   *Bulk Update* button.

-  At this point, don't worry about confirming that anything is junk
   mail.

Once you're done auditing for false positions, click the *Bulk Update*
button at the bottom of the list:

-  Click the :guilabel:`Save Changes` button
-  You may have to wait a couple minutes depending on the size of your
   list.
