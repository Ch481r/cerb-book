Guide for Group Managers
========================

If you've been given manager status in a group then you have autonomous
control over its roster, configuration, and workflow.

To manage a group:

1. Click *groups* in the top right.
2. Click the name of the group you would like to manage from the list on
   the left.

   Managing a group.

Group management is organized between several tabs:

-  **Mail:** Configures the group's mail preferences.
-  **Buckets:** Manages the group's organizational buckets.
-  **Virtual Attendant:** Configures the group's automated Virtual
   Attendant for various behavior; for example, routing new mail into
   buckets, or assigning workers to relevant conversations.
-  **Members:** Manages the group's roster.
-  **Custom Fields:** Each group can track their own custom fields on
   new tickets. For example, the Sales department may want to track the
   source (Google, website, ad) of leads while Support is interested in
   tracking the category of requests (FAQ, feature request, etc). These
   custom fields can be used to generate reports.
