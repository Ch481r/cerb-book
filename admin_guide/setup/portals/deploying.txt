On the :guilabel:`Installation` tab you will find two files that should be copied to your web server.

* :file:`index.php`
    This is the only file that is required to install your community portal on any PHP-enabled web server.
* :file:`.htaccess`
    Optional. If you're using the :program:`Apache` web server, this file will enable friendly URLs in your portal.
