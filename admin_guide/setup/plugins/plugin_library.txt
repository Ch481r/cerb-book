:menuselection:`Setup --> Plugins --> Plugin Library`

The Plugin Library tab provides a centralized place to view plugins which can be installed directly from within your Cerb installation. Plugins that are installed from the Plugin Library tab are downloaded from our server into your `storage/admin_guide/setup/plugins/` directory. The Plugin Library tab can also be used to the latest version of a plugin.

#. Click the :guilabel:`Save Changes` button.

Plugins may provide plugin-specific configuration options which are displayed upon enabling the plugin. These plugins typically provide integration with 3rd-party systems, and these configuration options are **required** for the plugin to work. Please see the :doc:`documentation for each plugin</plugins/index>` for instructions on how to properly configure these settings.
