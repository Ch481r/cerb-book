This page displays your license information.  A license determines the number of :term:`seats <seat>` that are available for simultaneous :doc:`workers </concepts/contexts/worker>`.  A license never expires, but it will only activate versions of Cerb that were released before its right to software updates expired.

When updating your license, be sure to type the company name and email address *exactly* as they appear on your order.  You can paste the entire license into the text box.

A license looks like::

    Licensed to: WebGroup Media, LLC.
    Order e-mail: wgm@example.com

Without a license, Cerb will operate in *Evaluation Mode*.  This permits a single worker to log in at a time.  This limit can be increased to three workers, at no cost, by completing the survey at the end of the :doc:`installation </installation/index>` process.
