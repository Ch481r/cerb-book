There are a few special pages in Cerb which need to be accessed without logging in:

- ``/cron``
    This page controls the :doc:`scheduler </admin_guide/setup/settings/scheduler>`.  It is usually accessed every minute from a scheduled task on your server.  You can generally whitelist ``127.0.0.1`` (the loopback address) to authorize requests for this page that originate from your server.
    
- ``/debug``
    This page provides debug information about your installation and environment that may be useful during troubleshooting.
    
- ``/update``
    This page is used to :doc:`upgrade </admin_guide/upgrading/index>` to a new version of Cerb.

To restrict access to trusted machines, these pages are protected by a whitelist of :abbr:`IP (Internet Protocol; e.g.: 192.168.1.1)` addresses.  You should enter one IP address per line in the text box.  You can also authorize a range of IPs by entering a partial address.  

For example:

``192.168.1.100``
    This authorizes a single IP

``192.168.1.1``
    With fewer than three digits in the last number, this authorizes the literal IP (``192.168.1.1``) as well as any IPs that match the prefix, like ``192.168.1.15`` or ``192.168.1.125``

``192.168.1.``
    This authorizes the 256 addresses between ``192.168.1.0`` and ``192.168.1.255``
    
``192.168.``
    This authorizes the 65,536 addresses that start with ``192.168.``
