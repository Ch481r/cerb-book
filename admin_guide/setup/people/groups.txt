Groups
------

Workers are organized into *groups*. Groups are a flexible concept that
can be based on anything: brand, product, department, timezone,
language, etc. By default you will have three groups based on common
departments: Dispatch, Support, and Sales. The defaults were chosen
because they're common departments across most industries, not because
they're all-encompassing. You are free to modify these groups to suit
your needs.

If you stick with the defaults, this is the proposed workflow:

-  **Dispatch** catches all mail that isn't explicitly routed somewhere.
   Some companies prefer to have a human dispatcher assign work -- to
   verify support eligibility and route issues based on worker skills --
   and this group is an easy way to achieve that. Because Cerb5 doesn't
   require incoming mail to always match a specific group, the Dispatch
   group is also the best way to spot incoming email addresses (like
   ``billing@example.com``) that you may want to route directly to a
   particular group.
-  **Support** collects issues related to support: product support,
   customer service, FAQs, billing, etc.
-  **Sales** collects issues related to sales: leads, new orders,
   refunds, resellers, etc.

The workers inside groups can either be *managers* or *members*. Groups
are designed to be autonomous; a group manager has the power to make
most configuration changes related to the group without requiring help
from an administrator. Managers can add new members to the group, manage
buckets, and configure workflow using the group's Virtual Attendant.

The common practice is to use groups for building a roster of fairly
interchangeable workers. Work can be given to the group from the outside
with the confidence that any member knows what to do with it. Groups
share an organization system based on *buckets*, but workers outside the
group aren't expected to know how other groups organize their work (and
it shouldn't matter to them). Instead, new work is given to groups
through their *inbox*, and the group's own filters will decide how work
is routed or assigned from there.

Let's add a couple new groups. At this point you're also welcome to
change the default groups.

-  Click *setup* in the top right.
-  Click the *Workers & Groups* menu.
-  Click the *Groups* menu item.
-  Click the name of a group on the left, or click *add a new group* to
   create one.

   Configuring a group.

-  **Name** is what the group will be referred to as throughout the
   interface.
-  **Members** is the list of workers that you would like to designate
   as members or managers.

From this point, the managers of your new group can take over. They
should refer to the `Quick Start Guide for Group
Managers <#quick-start-guide-for-group-managers>`_.
