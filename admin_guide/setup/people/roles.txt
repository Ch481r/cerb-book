    :alt: Configuring roles.

This page configures :doc:`roles </concepts/contexts/role>`.

Without a role, all actions are prohibited.

By default you will have a single role that grants all :term:`privileges <privilege>` to every :doc:`worker </concepts/contexts/worker>`.  You can modify the default role to establish baseline permissions for your workers.  Even with full privileges, non-:term:`administrator` workers will not be able to access the :doc:`Setup </admin_guide/setup/index>` page. Administrators are automatically granted full privileges and roles do not apply to them.

To add a new role, click the :guilabel:`Add` button.

Who
===

A role can be applied to:

- **Everyone**
    This applies the role to every worker.  This is useful for establishing a baseline of global privileges.

- **Specific groups**
    This applies the role to every worker who is a member of at least one of these groups.  This is often the most useful option since you can establish baseline permissions for each group without having to explicitly grant privileges to new workers.

- **Specific workers**
    This applies the role to an explicit list of workers.  This should be used when you want to grant special privileges to workers in a way that can't be generalized.
   
What
====
    
Roles can grant privileges in the following ways:

- **All**
    A role provides every privilege to the worker associated with it.  This is generally only useful if you want to bypass permissions and give workers unrestricted access.

- **None**
    A role provides no privileges at all.  You would use this when you want to associate workers by role for purposes other than granting privileges.  For example, a role can own :doc:`workspaces </concepts/workspaces>` and :doc:`snippets </concepts/snippets/index>`, and share that content with its workers.

- **Itemized**
    A role provides an explicit subset from the full list of privileges.  This is the most common option.
