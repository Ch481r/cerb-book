A :doc:`worker </concepts/contexts/worker>` is a person who represents your organization while performing their duties.  Workers might be in customer service, billing, sales, I.T., or marketing; or they may be executives, developers, or system administrators.

If this is a brand new helpdesk, then there is probably only worker at the moment -- you.

Start collaborating by inviting your co-workers with the :guilabel:`Add Worker` button.

- In :guilabel:`Contact Information` you can update a worker's name, title, and email address. Keep in mind that if you change a worker's primary email address it will become their new helpdesk login.

- :guilabel:`Authentication` is used to update a worker's password, and you can also promote them to :term:`Administrator`, which will give them the permission to do absolutely everything in the helpdesk; they are like the ``root`` account on Unix-based systems, or the ``Administrator`` account in Windows. Only workers who are administrators can enter :doc:`Setup </admin_guide/setup/index>`. Grant administrator access judiciously.

- Lastly, the :guilabel:`Memberships` box defines the worker's membership to each of your :doc:`groups </concepts/contexts/group>`. You can also designate the worker as a :term:`manager` of a group. Managers can perform group-level administration: adding other workers as new group :term:`members <member>`, creating :term:`buckets <bucket>` for organizing the group's work, etc.

When you've finished with your changes, click the :guilabel:`Save Changes` button.
