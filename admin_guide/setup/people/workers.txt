Workers
-------

The people who log in to Cerb5 to accomplish work and represent your
organization to your audience are called *workers*. These workers might
work in customer service, billing, sales, I.T., or marketing; or they
may be executives, developers, or system administrators.

If this is a brand new helpdesk, the only worker that exists at the
moment is yourself. This is the account that was created for you during
the installation process.

1. Click *setup* in the top right.
2. Click the *Workers & Groups* menu.
3. Select the *Workers* menu item.

First, let's update your own account information. Click the link on the
first or last name of *Super User* in the *Workers* list.

   Configuring a worker account.

-  In **Contact Information** you can update a worker's name, title, and
   email address. Keep in mind that if you change a worker's primary
   email address it will become their new helpdesk login.

-  **Authentication** is used to update a worker's password, and you can
   also promote them to *Administrator*, which will give them the
   permission to do absolutely everything in the helpdesk; they are like
   the ``root`` account on Unix-based systems, or the ``Administrator``
   account in Windows. Only workers who are administrators can enter
   *Setup*. Grant administrator access judiciously.

-  Lastly, the **Memberships** box defines the worker's *membership* to
   each of your groups. You can also designate the worker as a *manager*
   of a group. Managers can perform group-level administration: adding
   other workers as new group *members*, creating *buckets* for
   organizing the group's work, etc.

When you've finished with your changes, click the :guilabel:`Save Changes` button.

Start collaborating by inviting your co-workers with the *Add Worker*
button. In the next step we'll organize your workers into groups.
