This page configures the SMTP server for outgoing mail.

Configuring the outgoing SMTP server
====================================

You can configure the SMTP server in the :guilabel:`Settings` section.  The following configuration options are available:

**SMTP Server**
    The hostname or IP of your mail server.  If your mail server is on the same machine as your web server, you can usually use ``localhost`` for this setting.

**SMTP Port**
    The network `port <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_port_(software)>`_ to connect to on your mail server.  By default this is ``25``, but your mail server may require a non-standard port.

**SMTP Encryption**
    - **None**
        No encryption will be used.
    - **TLS**
        The SMTP connection will be encrypted with `Transport Layer Security <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security>`_ encryption, the successor to SSL.
    - **SSL**
        The SMTP connection will be encrypted with `Secure Socket Layer <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Socket_Layer>`_ encryption, the predecessor to TLS.

**SMTP Authentication**
    **Enabled**
        If this checkbox is enabled, then SMTP authentication credentials will be sent to the server.  This is necessary if your mail server requires authentication.
    **Username**
        The username to authenticate with.
    **Password**
        The password to authenticate with.

**SMTP Timeout**
    A number of seconds to wait for a response from the SMTP server.  After this timeout, the connection will be broken and the message will be saved as a draft.
    
**Maximum Deliveries per SMTP Connection**
    The number of messages to send over the same SMTP connection.  After this number of message, the SMTP connection will be re-established before sending additional messages.  The default of ``20`` should work for most environments, but you may need to lower this value if your SMTP server is strict.

.. note::
    Your SMTP server settings will be tested automatically when you click the :guilabel:`Save Changes` button.
    
.. note::
    If your SMTP settings are invalid, or your mail server is temporarily offline, all outgoing email will be saved as drafts.
