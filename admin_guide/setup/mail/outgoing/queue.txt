This page displays the current contents of the outgoing mail queue.  Mail is added to the queue when it is sent in bulk from a :doc:`broadcast </concepts/broadcast>`, or if the original delivery failed and it needs to be retried.  A message that fails delivery will retry a maximum of ten times before being automatically converted back to a draft.

Previewing queued messages
==========================

You can preview a queued message by clicking on the :doc:`peek </concepts/worklists/peek>` button next to any object in the :doc:`worklist </concepts/worklists/index>`.
