This page configures the mailboxes that will be checked for new mail.

.. note::
    It is highly recommended that you configure a single mailbox as a "dropbox".  Even if you have dozens of email addresses, you can redirect their mail to a single mailbox.  For example, you can redirect ``sales@example.com`` and ``support@example.com`` to ``cerb5@example.com``.  Your :doc:`routing </admin_guide/setup/mail/incoming/routing>` and :doc:`mail filtering </admin_guide/setup/mail/incoming/filtering>` will still be able to identify the original destination.  This is much more efficient than monitoring several mailboxes.

Adding a mailbox
================

Click the :guilabel:`Add` button to register an existing mailbox.

A mailbox has the following fields:

**Enabled**
    If this checkbox is enabled then new mail will be downloaded from this mailbox.  Otherwise, this mailbox will not be checked until it is re-enabled.
    
**Nickname**
    A friendly name to use for this mailbox when it is displayed in the interface.
    
**Protocol**
    The protocol to use when connecting to this mailbox:
    
    - **POP3**
        `Post Office Protocol <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office_Protocol>`_.  The POP3 protocol supports a simpler set of instructions than IMAP.
    - **POP3-SSL**
        This is the same as POP3, except the connection will be encrypted with SSL.
    - **IMAP**
        `Internet Message Access Protocol <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol>`_.  The IMAP protocol supports advanced features like server-side folders; however, this functionality overlaps with Cerb and is not used.
    - **IMAP-SSL**
        This is the same as IMAP, except the connection will be encrypted with SSL.
        
    .. note::
        Most mail servers support any of these protocols.  As far as Cerb is concerned, there is no functional difference between POP3 or IMAP. 
    
**Username**
    The username used to authenticate access to this mailbox.  Depending on your mail server, this may be a simple username (e.g. `support`) or an email address (e.g. `support@example.com`).  If you aren't sure, ask your system administrator.
    
**Password**
    The password used to authenticate access to this mailbox.
    
**Port**
    The network `port <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_port_(software)>`_ to connect to on the mail server.  If this field is left blank then the standard ports will be used by default.  If your mail server uses a non-standard port then you will need to enter that number here.
    
**Delete**
    If this checkbox is selected then the mailbox will be deleted when you save.
    
    .. note::
        Deleting a mailbox will **not** affect any previously downloaded mail.

.. warning::
    Cerb will delete messages from your mailbox after downloading them.  If this is not desirable, create a new mailbox and have copies of your mail redirected there.  This process is not necessary when using a Gmail mailbox, because Google ignores delete requests by default and refers instead to a configurable option.
    
.. warning::
    If you aren't using SSL then your password will be sent in cleartext.  This might be a security issue depending on the network between your web server and mail server.  Use SSL whenever possible.
    
Testing a mailbox
=================

You can verify your mailbox connection details by clicking the :guilabel:`Test Mailbox` button.
