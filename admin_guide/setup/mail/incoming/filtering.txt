A :doc:`Virtual Attendant </concepts/virtual_attendants/index>` screens all incoming mail before it is accepted by the system.  You can add new behavior to this attendant to modify, redirect, or reject certain kinds of messages.

Rejecting messages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rejecting mail is useful when you want to completely ignore mail coming into your helpdesk. Rejecting mail is as simple as selecting the *Reject delivery of message* action.

For a more comprehensive example, see our documentation on :doc:`Disabling built-in relay authentication </admin_guide/setup/mail/incoming/external_relay>`.

Changing the order of mail filters
==================================

There are times when the execution order of your mail filters matters.  For example, if you want to modify a message by adding a custom header before any other filters are checked.

To change the execution order of your mail filtering behavior, click and drag the title of each behavior.
