The :guilabel:`Settings` section has the following configuration options:

**Reply to All**
    If this checkbox is selected then every email address in the :mailheader:`To:` and :mailheader:`Cc:` headers will also be added as :term:`recipients <recipient>`.  By default, only the :mailheader:`From:` address is treated as a recipient, although the additional email addresses can be quickly added when replying.
    
**Always exclude these addresses as recipients**
    The email addresses on this blacklist will never be added as recipients.  This is useful if you receive messages from an automated sender; for example, receipts from a credit card processor.
        
**Attachments**

    **Allow incoming attachments**
        If this checkbox is selected then attachments will be accepted by the system.  If blank then email attachments will be ignored, but the remaining message will be delivered like normal.
        
    **Maximum attachment size**
        Attachments that are larger than this size in megabytes (MB) will be ignored.  Regardless of this setting, many email services also have an attachment file size limit of approximately 10-20MB.

Default Ticket Mask Format
==========================

In the :guilabel:`Default Ticket Mask Format` section you can change the pattern used to generate :doc:`ticket </concepts/contexts/ticket>` :term:`masks <mask>`.
    
The following tokens are available:

- **L**
    A random uppercase letter from A-Z (excluding O)
- **N**
    A random numeric digit from 1-9 (excluding zero)
- **C**
    A random alphanumeric character (A-Z, 1-9, excluding O and zero)
- **Y**
    The current year in 4 digits (e.g. 2012)
- **M**
    The current month in 2 digits (e.g. 12)
- **D**
    The current day in 2 digits (e.g. 21)
- **{TEXT}**
    The literal text within the curly braces will be used.  This allows you to use the characters: C, D, L, M, N, Y.  For example, the mask format ``{WGM}-CCCCC`` will generate masks like ``WGM-A65BT``.

The ticket mask format you provide must be able to generate at least one million distinct variations.  Using at least five letters (``LLLLL``) will give you more than 10 million combinations.  Five alphanumeric characters (``CCCCC``) will provide more than 45 million.  The default (``LLL-NNNNN-NNN``) provides more than 672 billion.

.. note:: 
    As mentioned above, the letter O and the number 0 (zero) are never used in ticket masks because they are very similar to each other.  Additionally, uppercase letters are always used to make it easier to dictate ticket masks out loud.  You can modify the code to change this behavior.  Five random characters using the full alphabet in uppercase and lowercase, and 10 digits, provide nearly one billion combinations in a very short mask.  However, six random alphanumeric characters, using Cerb's defaults, provide over 1.5 billion combinations in a much more legible format.

.. note:: 
    You may be tempted to add a consistent prefix to the beginning of all your ticket masks.  This is perfectly acceptable, however you may incur a slight performance penalty when retrieving tickets by mask.  This is because the database is tuned to index the first few characters of a ticket mask rather than the entire string (which is always be unique).
