:menuselection:`Setup --> Mail --> Incoming Mail --> Routing`

This page instructs the system how to route incoming mail to :doc:`group </concepts/contexts/group>` :term:`inboxes <inbox>` based on message properties.

Setting the default group
=========================

    :figclass: bordered

The default group will receive any mail that isn't explicitly routed somewhere else.  By default this is set to the *Dispatch* group.

For example, if you route mail by the :mailheader:`To:` field, the default group will be used when mail is sent to an email address that you haven't configured.  Mail will also be delivered here if someone includes your organization in the  :mailheader:`Bcc:` list.

.. note::
    You can route mail based on any property, not just the :mailheader:`To:` field.  The default group will only be used if none of your routing rules instruct the system to deliver mail to a specific group.

Creating a new routing rule
===========================

You can add a new routing rule by clicking the :guilabel:`Add` button.

In the :guilabel:`Rule name` field, provide a description of how this routing rule makes decisions.  For example:

- *Send receipts to Billing*
- *Route support@\* to Support*

By default, routing rules are checked in an order determined by how often they are used (most popular first).  If the :guilabel:`Sticky` checkbox is selected then this routing rule can be manually ordered and it will execute before any automatically ordered rules.

Any combination of the following criteria can be used to route mail:

- **Current Date/Time**
    - **Day of Week**
        The days of the week where this routing rule is applicable.
    - **Time of Day**
        A time range where this routing rule should apply.
- **Message**
    - **To/Cc**
        A comma-delimited list of email addresses, or partial address patterns, to check for a match in the :mailheader:`To:` or :mailheader:`Cc:` headers.  Only one of these addresses must match.  Wildcards are denoted by an asterisk (``*``); for example, ``support@*``
    - **From**
        A sender email address to match.  Wildcards are denoted by an asterisk (``*``); for example, ``*@vip.example.com``
    - **Subject**
        A subject to match.  Wildcards are denoted by an asterisk (``*``); for example, ``New Order: *``
    - **Body Content**
        A `regular expression <http://us2.php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.syntax.php>`_ to match against the message contents.
- **Message headers**
    Arbitrary message headers to match.  The first column is the header name (e.g. :mailheader:`X-Mailer``, :mailheader:`Content-Type``) and the second column is the value to match against.  Wildcards are denoted by an asterisk (``*``); for example, ``Cerb*``
- **Sender custom fields**
    The custom fields to match against the :doc:`address </concepts/contexts/address>` in the :mailheader:`From:` header.
- **Sender organization custom fields**
    The custom fields to match against the :doc:`organization </concepts/contexts/organization>` of the address in the :mailheader:`From:` header.

Click the :guilabel:`Save Changes` button to save your new routing rule.
