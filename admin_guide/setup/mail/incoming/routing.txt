Routing

:menuselection:`Setup --> Mail --> Incoming Mail --> Routing`

Cerb5 will determine the appropriate ``From:`` address to use on
outgoing email based on the group or bucket. These are collectively
referred to as *Receipts* addresses\_.

For example:

-  The Billing group may send mail as ``billing@example.com``
-  The Billing group's *Receipts* bucket may send mail as
   ``receipts@example.com``
-  The Sales group may send mail as ``sales@example.com``

To ensure that you receive customer replies, it is very important that
your mail servers route these reply-to addresses to a mailbox that is
checked by Cerb5.

You can add new reply-to addresses from Setup:

1. Click *setup* in the top right.
2. Click the *Mail* menu.
3. Select the *Reply-To Addresses* menu item.

Click the *Add* button to add a new reply-to address, and enter the
following information:

-  **Send replies as email:** This specifies an email address to use as
   the sender in ``From:``.
-  **Send replies as name:** This allows you to provide a personal name
   that will display next to the sender address when your recipient
   reads their email. For example, ``billing@example.com`` may use the
   personal name *"Widget Factory - Billing Dept."*. This gives the
   recipient an idea of who you are; especially if they don't recognize
   your email address.
-  **Default signature template:** This defines the default worker
   signature that will be used when mail is sent from this email
   address. You can use placeholders like the current worker's name or
   title, which will automatically fill in the appropriate values
   depending on who is sending the email. You can also use conditional
   logic and modifiers in this template. Refer to the section about
   Snippets for more information.
-  **Make default:** If you check this box the current address will
   become the default reply-to address. That means it will be used in
   situations where there is no group or bucket; for example, sending
   out reminders for forgotten passwords.

You can repeat this process for any additional reply-to addresses you
want to add.

There is nothing wrong with using a single reply-to address for all
outgoing mail -- in fact, that may simplify your mail server
configuration considerably, and you can still personalize the sender
name for each group or bucket. If you have multiple products, brands, or
initiatives, you may want to configure a reply-to address for each of
them so your audience can instantly recognize who you are and why you're
contacting them. Otherwise, a busy or inattentive recipient may
unintentionally delete your message as spam because they don't recognize
the sender.
