PHP opcode caching with XCache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a webserver receives an HTTP request for a PHP script, the
human-readable source code is compiled into a machine-friendly format
called *opcodes*  [1]_. By default, opcodes are only kept around long
enough to serve an individual request and then they're disposed of to
free up resources.

The default behavior makes sense in a shared hosting environment where
dozens of scripts and applications may be sharing the same system
resources. However, as you can imagine, when a single PHP web-app
receives a disproportionately large amount of the traffic then the
process of constantly recompiling its source code can become a
performance bottleneck.

**XCache** (http://xcache.lighttpd.net/) is an extension for PHP which
caches the most frequently-accessed scripts in the machine-friendly
opcode format. Typically, XCache is a moderate, turnkey
performance-boost that doesn't require any application-level changes to
benefit from the cache.

Installing XCache
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installing XCache is an advanced topic. If you don't have
administrator-level control of your server then it's likely not
something you're going to be able to do.

XCache is not found in the **PHP Extension and Application Repository
(PEAR)** (http://pear.php.net/), so you'll need to install it through a
package manager or compile it manually.

On Debian and Ubuntu systems you can install XCache with ``apt-get``:

::

    $ sudo apt-get install php5-xcache

Depending on your installation method the XCache configuration will be
at the end of your ``php.ini`` file, or in a ``conf.d/xcache.ini`` file.

If you have other applications on your webserver that you don't want to
be managed by XCache, you can disable caching by default with the
following settings in your ``php.ini`` or ``conf.d/xcache.ini`` file:

::

    xcache.cacher = Off

Then you can add the following option in your virtual host configuration
or an ``.htaccess`` file:

::

    php_flag xcache.cacher On

Don't use Alternative PHP Cache (APC)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Alternative PHP Cache (APC)**  [2]_ is a popular choice for opcode
caching because it's part of PEAR, which makes installing it really
simple. However, APC suffers from some major drawbacks. It has limited
support for recent versions of PHP, and there are many situations where
it will produce segmentation faults  [3]_, cryptic ``FATAL`` errors on
*"Line 0"*  [4]_, or blank white pages in the web browser.

Memcached
~~~~~~~~~

One of the major sources of latency in web applications is often
database interaction. Databases are used to save information between
sessions (*persistence*), and they provide functionality for sorting,
joining, and filtering large collections of information. Databases are a
natural fit for *dynamic* content -- that which changes frequently as
people use the application (e.g. profiles, voting, comments).

The use of a database may feel so convenient for novice developers that
they begin to serve all content that way, including *static* content --
that which doesn't change while the application is in use (e.g. HTML
templates, CSS stylesheets, files for download).

In our experience, the worst kind of content to frequently read from a
database is *immutable* -- that which is written once and then *never*
changes (e.g. email messages, file attachments, log entries).

There is nothing inherently wrong with storing this information in a
database. Issues arise when infrequently changed information is
*frequently* read from the database, due to the overhead of aggregating,
joining, filtering, sorting, and returning results. At best, the
database itself caches the results of these extraneous read queries. At
worst, the database expends considerable resources every request to
retrieve data that hasn't changed in the past 1,000 read queries.

**Memcached** (http://memcached.org/) provides a shared memory cache for
arbitrary information. This allows static or immutable content to be
retrieved from the database once and then requested many times without
incurring database overhead. Even better, content in a single Memcached
instance can be cached from multiple databases, and read by multiple
servers.

Memcached advantages:

-  Shared memory allows multiple processes to share a single cache.
-  Memcached instances can be shared by multiple readers.
-  Cache requests can be distributed over multiple instances.
-  Reading from Memcached is often faster than reading from a database;
   especially when content has been pre-sorted and pre-filtered, and is
   cached in a serialized object format (e.g. JSON) that can be quickly
   reconstituted by the application. Information read from databases is
   usually based on rows and columns, and these need to be reassembled
   into objects which have a considerable overhead cost if performed
   frequently.

Memcached disadvantages:

-  Applications need to be designed with Memcached support in mind.
-  It's volatile memory and shouldn't be used to store anything that you
   can't repopulate from a persistent source (like the filesystem or a
   database).
-  It's yet another process running on your server.
-  It provides no means of authentication. That's up to you.

Installing Memcached
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It's often best to install Memcached from your platform's package
manager; however, some distributions (such as Debian Etch) will install
rather old versions. You want version 1.2.2 or later.

You'll use PECL to install **PHP's Memcached extension**
(http://us3.php.net/memcached). The similarly named **Memcache
extension** (http://us3.php.net/memcache) will also work, although it is
an older library with fewer features.

Once Memcached is installed you need to edit your Cerb6
``framework.config.php`` file and change the following lines:

::

    //define('DEVBLOCKS_CACHE_PREFIX',''); // ONLY A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and underscore
    //define('DEVBLOCKS_MEMCACHED_SERVERS','127.0.0.1:11211');

To something like:

::

    define('DEVBLOCKS_CACHE_PREFIX','myhelpdesk'); // ONLY A-Z, a-z, 0-9 and underscore
    define('DEVBLOCKS_MEMCACHED_SERVERS','127.0.0.1:11211');

-  ``DEVBLOCKS_CACHE_PREFIX`` - This prefix allows multiple applications
   to share a single Memcached. If no prefix is used, then only one
   application can use a particular key (e.g. "worker\_list"). The
   prefix can be anything as long as it's unique. We often suggest using
   the database name as the prefix.

-  ``DEVBLOCKS_MEMCACHED_SERVERS`` - This is a list of Memcached
   instances to distribute requests between. Usually you won't need more
   than a single Memcached instance, but if you want to distribute
   requests then add more host:port pairs delimited by commas (e.g.
   ``127.0.0.1:11211, 127.0.0.2:11211``).

Security implications of Memcached
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, Memcached does not have any form of authentication. Make
sure you don't bind Memcached to a publicly-accessible network interface
without establishing firewall rules. It defaults to only serving local
requests on the ``127.0.0.1`` address.

You also need to consider if other local users and scripts can connect
to Memcached's port (``11211`` by default). Choosing a unique prefix
will help safeguard your cached data, but it shouldn't be all you rely
on.

In summary:

-  Don't bind Memcached to a public network interface without firewall
   rules.
-  Consider that local users can connect to Memcached's port. Choosing a
   non-standard port is a decent start, but local users with shell
   access can easily discover running services with commands like:

::

    netstat --tcp -l

-  If you don't set a prefix for Memcached keys then anyone connecting
   to the port can read your cached information if they're familiar with
   an application's source code (and Cerb's source code is
   world-readable).
