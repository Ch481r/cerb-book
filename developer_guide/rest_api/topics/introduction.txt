Introduction
------------

The `REST <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST>`_-based Web `API <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API>`_ provides the ability to remote control Cerb for automation, synchronization, and integration. For example, you can use the API from other applications and services to create tickets, search records, monitor notifications, manage tasks, and interact with Virtual Attendants.

The API uses per-application credentials and per-worker permissions to authorize API requests. It supports returning data in XML or JSON.

Enable the Web API plugin
=========================

The Web API functionality is provided through a built-in :doc:`plugin </plugins/index>`. Make sure that the :doc:`Web API plugin </plugins/cerberusweb.restapi>` is enabled before continuing.

Credentials
===========

To access the Web API, a worker generates a *credentials* key-pair consisting of an *access key* and a *secret key*.  Credentials can be created with restricted access to only specific Cerb features. For example, you can create credentials that can only read notifications.

To generate new API credentials:

* Click on the :ref:`worker menu <ui_worker_menu>` in the top right of the navigation bar.

* Click on :guilabel:`settings`.

* Click the :guilabel:`API Credentials` tab.

* Click the green :guilabel:`+` icon at the top of the :guilabel:`Web API Credentials` worklist.

* Enter :kbd:`Everything` for the :guilabel:`Label`.  Optionally, you can use a more descriptive name that makes it easier to remember where the credentials will be used (e.g. "Campfire Virtual Attendant").

* Enter :kbd:`*` for the :guilabel:`Allowed paths`.  Optionally, you can restrict this to specific request paths (e.g. ``tickets/*``).

* Click the :guilabel:`Save Changes` button.

* Click on the newly created credentials in the worklist, then make a note of your :guilabel:`Access Key` and :guilabel:`Secret Key`.
