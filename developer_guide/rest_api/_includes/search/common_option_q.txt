The quick search query text to filter with.  Quick search can filter on multiple fields at once, and is generally much simpler to use than the criteria/oper/value tuples below; although both options can be combined (for instance, allowing a client to quick search in fulltext, while restricting the results to their own content with explcit criteria).  The syntax for these queries is exactly the same as in the web interface, so you can test queries in Cerb before using them in the API.
