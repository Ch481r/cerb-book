Downloading Cerb from GitHub
============================

Installing Git
--------------

We use `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ for distributed source control and versioning. You can test if Git is currently installed by running the command::

    git --version

If Git is not installed, you can download the latest version for your platform from: http://git-scm.com/download

Pulling the project files from GitHub
-------------------------------------

Our `project <https://github.com/wgm/cerb6>`_ and `plugin repositories <https://github.com/cerb-plugins/repositories>`_ are hosted on `GitHub <http://www.github.com/>`_. You don't need a GitHub account to download our project files, but we recommend creating one so you can take advantage of the collaborative tools.

Navigate to the web-accessible directory for the appropriate virtual host (or default) of your local webserver. For example, if you're using Apache this path is usually something like :file:`/var/www/`. On a Windows server with IIS it may be ``C:\Inetpub\``.

If you're only developing third-party plugins...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you only intend to work on your own custom plugins then you can anonymously use our repositories with read-only access.

Issue the following command at the console::

    git clone https://github.com/wgm/cerb6.git

If you plan to contribute to Cerb6, and work on plugins...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you plan to contribute patches (e.g. bug fixes) to the Cerb6 project, in addition to working on custom plugins, we recommend that you *fork* the project on GitHub. This will create your own copy of our official repository that you can *commit* (save) your changes to. It also makes it easier for us to view and integrate those changes.

* `Create a free account at GitHub <https://github.com/signup/free>`_ if you don't already have one.
* Once logged in, browse to https://github.com/wgm/cerb6
* Click the :guilabel:`Fork` button in the top right. This will create your own personal repository for making modifications to Cerb.

When your repository is created, use the credentials from the SSH section on your page at GitHub to download your files.

For example::

    git clone git@github.com:{you}/cerb6.git

*Replace {you} with your account name at GitHub.*

.. note::

    You can also use a graphical Git client like `TortoiseGit <http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/>`_ for Windows or `Tower.app <http://www.git-tower.com/>`_ for Mac; however, it is worth becoming proficient with the command line interface to Git since it will always provide you with full functionality. Git also comes with a simple GUI for managing your repository which can be accessed with the ``git gui`` command.

    At WebGroup Media (WGM), we develop on Macs and use `GitX <http://brotherbard.com/blog/2010/03/experimental-gitx-fork/>`_ to make it easy to visually audit changes before staging and committing them. Everything else is accomplished from the command line.
