cerberusweb.rest.controller
---------------------------

The **cerberusweb.rest.controller** extension point allows you to add new objects to the :doc:`Rest API</developer_guide/rest_api/index>`. Your class needs to extend :php:class:`Extension_RestController`, and it also needs to implement ``IExtensionRestController``.

Plugin Manifest
===============

In :doc:`plugin.xml </developer_guide/plugins/plugin.xml>`:

.. code-block:: xml
    
    <!-- Support Center Controller -->
    <extension point="cerberusweb.rest.controller">
		<id>example.rest.controller</id>
		<name>Example Rest Controller</name>
		<class>
			<file>api/App.php</file>
			<name>ExampleRestController</name>
		</class>
		<params>
			<param key="uri" value="example" />
		</params>
	</extension>

**<param key="uri" value="example">**
    Binds the rest controller to the ``example`` url.
        
Implementation
==============
.. php:class:: ExampleRestController extends Extension_RestController implements IExtensionRestController

    .. php:method:: getAction($stack)
        
        :param array $stack: An array representing the requested path.
        
        This method is called when the get method is invoked on your REST controller. You'll need to determine which method to call based on the stack.
        
    .. php:method:: putAction($stack)
        
        This method is called when the put method is invoked on your REST controller. You'll need to determine which method to call based on the stack.
        
    .. php:method:: postAction($stack)
        
        This method is called when the post method is invoked on your REST controller. You'll need to determine which method to call based on the stack.

    .. php:method:: deleteAction($stack)
        
        This method is called when the delete method is invoked on your REST controller. You'll need to determine which method to call based on the stack.
