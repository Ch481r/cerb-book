Email Relay Commands
--------------------

You can use the following tags when replying to proxy email. Each tag must appear on its own line.

#watch
======

Start watching this conversation.

.. code-block:: none
	
	#watch

#unwatch
========

Stop watching this conversation.

.. code-block:: none
	
	#unwatch
	
#sig
====

Insert your full signature on the current line (based on the conversation's group and bucket).

.. code-block:: none
	
	#sig

#status
=======
Change conversation status to the specified status.

.. code-block:: none

	#status open

.. code-block:: none

	#status waiting

.. code-block:: none

	#status closed

#reopen
=======
If waiting or closed, reopen the conversation at the given time.

.. code-block:: none

	#reopen +2 days

.. code-block:: none

	#reopen next Tuesday

#comment
========
Add a private comment to the conversation timeline. **Important:** By default, a comment is *in addition* to your reply. If you don't want to send a reply, use the *#noreply* tag below.

.. code-block:: none

	#comment This is a comment from a reply to an email sent to a worker via Email Relay.

#noreply
========
Only apply tags to the conversation and do not send anything to requesters.

.. code-block:: none

	#status waiting
	#reopen +2 days
	#comment We need to check up on this guys stuff.
	#noreply

#cut
====
Ignore all content below this line when sending a reply. This is useful in mobile email clients where deleting quoted text is tedious. 

.. code-block:: none
	
	It works fine on our end, and according to thousands
	of other people using the software without any problem.
	
	#cut
	#status waiting

Examples
========

Watch, comment, and don't send a reply
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This will comment, add you as a ticket watcher, but not send reply to requesters:

.. code-block:: none

	#watch
	#comment I'll take care of this on Monday.
	#noreply

Comment, set status to closed, stop watching, and don't send a reply
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This will comment, close a message, stop watching, but not send reply to requesters:

.. code-block:: none

	#comment I called the client a couple minutes ago and we resolved this.
	#status closed
	#unwatch
	#noreply

Reply, insert signature, cut remaining text, set status to waiting, reopen in two days
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This will reply, insert your signature, set the status to waiting, and set the ticket to reopen in two days, and most importantly tell Cerb *not to send* anything to the requester that appears below the #cut line. Since mobile email clients often reply above quoted text, you can use the #cut tag to instruct Cerb to ignore the rest of your message without laboriously deleting text.

.. code-block:: none

	This is my quick reply to the customer.

	#sig
	#cut
	#status waiting
	#reopen +2 days
