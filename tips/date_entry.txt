Entering dates
--------------

Cerb accepts date entry in multiple formats:

-  -2 days
-  +1 year, 3 months
-  April 27 2001
-  9 Jan 2002 8am
-  yesterday / today / now / tomorrow
-  next Monday
-  last Thursday 5pm
-  2011-01-01 20:30:15
-  Dec 31 2012 +30 days

If you don't specify a time then the default is 00:00:00 (midnight at
the start of the day). Dates are relative to your current timezone
(defined in My Account), but they are always stored in the database as
UTC/GMT.

When you're doing a search with dates you should be sure to enter an
explicit end time. The search *"from today to tomorrow"* will include
anything that happened today (from 00:00:00 to 23:59:59). However, the
search *"from today to today"* will likely return zero results because
it's looking for activity within the first second of today (from
00:00:00 to 00:00:00 inclusive).

It is often useful to use relative dates in macros and :ref:`Virtual Attendant <concept_virtual_attendants>` behavior, because setting a date (e.g. a due date) of *+2 hours* will always be 2 hours in the future regardless of the current time.
