Description
===========

Gauges can be used to visualize server resources in real-time by connecting them to sensors.  This requires the :doc:`sensors plugin </plugins/cerberusweb.datacenter.sensors>` to be installed and enabled.

The needle reflects the current metric of the sensor -- CPU load average, disk space utilization, memory usage, webserver connections, concurrent users, etc.

This style of gauge has three colored zones:

* **Green (OK):** No action is needed
* **Yellow (Warning):** Preventative action should be taken soon
* **Red (Critical):** Emergency action must be taken

You can set the thresholds for these zones based on your needs.  For example, a disk usage gauge may change to the *Warning* state above 80% utilization and go *Critical* above 90%.  A CPU load average gauge may go *Warning* above 5.0 and *Critical* above 15.0.  These levels will depend on your particular environment. 

Instructions
============  

1. Navigate to a dashboard, or :doc:`create one </cookbook/workspaces/dashboards/create>` if you haven't already.

2. Click the :guilabel:`Add Widget` button:
