Description
===========

You can chart your Service Level Agreement (SLA) response times to get a visual indication of your organization's compliance.  This example assumes that you guarantee a first response within 4 hours.

The data is rendered as a bar chart with a bar for each day.  The number of compliant replies -- where the first response was sent within 4 hours -- are drawn in green.  The red bars show the number of replies on a given day where the client waited more than 4 hours for their first response.  Taken together, these bars give you a daily compliance ratio.

Instructions
============

1. Navigate to a dashboard, or :doc:`create one </cookbook/workspaces/dashboards/create>` if you haven't already.
 
2. Click the :guilabel:`Add Widget` button:

3. Select :guilabel:`Type:` **Chart** and click the :guilabel:`Continue` button:

4. Configure the :guilabel:`Data Source` tab as shown below.  There are two series that load ticket data.  The :guilabel:`X-axis` plots the :guilabel:`created` date :guilabel:`by day`.  The :guilabel:`Y-axis` plots the count (or frequency).  The labels and colors are different, but all the other settings should be identical.  You'll configure each worklist separately in the following steps.

5. Click on the :guilabel:`Worklist` button for :guilabel:`Series #1`.  This ticket worklist should be filtered as follows:

* Status is not **Deleted**.
* First Response < **14400**
* Created between **-30 days to now**

The value of `14400` in the *First Response* filter is a number of seconds (60 seconds * 60 minutes * 4 hours).  You can change this value to your own response time threshold (in seconds).

6. Click on the :guilabel:`Worklist` button for :guilabel:`Series #2`.  This ticket worklist is nearly identical to the one you just set up for the first series, but the *Response Time* filter is checking for a value greater than or equal to `14400` instead.  As above, if you're using a different threshold then enter that number of seconds here instead.

* Status is not **Deleted**.
* First Response >= **14400**
* Created between **-30 days to now**

7. Finally, click on the :guilabel:`Chart Type` tab and select :guilabel:`Bar Chart`.  This will display a stacked bar chart, which is better for making direct comparisons between two or more series.

8. Once you're finished setting up your new chart, click the :guilabel:`Save Changes` button.  The chart should now be displayed on your dashboard.
