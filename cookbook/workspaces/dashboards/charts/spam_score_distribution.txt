Description
===========

This chart visualizes the distribution of spam scores.  A low, flat line indicates a large amount of legitimate non-spam messages.  A high, flat line indicates a large amount of junk messages.  A steep curve indicates very little variation between very legitimate and very suspicious messages.  A gradual curve indicates a wider variation.

Instructions
============

1. Navigate to a dashboard, or :doc:`create one </cookbook/workspaces/dashboards/create>` if you haven't already.

2. Click the :guilabel:`Add Widget` button:

4. This chart has a single series of *ticket* data on the :guilabel:`Data Source` tab.  The :guilabel:`X-axis` has a plot for each record in the worklist.  The :guilabel:`Y-axis` plots the **value** of the **spam score** field for each record.

5. Click on the :guilabel:`Worklist` button for :guilabel:`Series #1`.  You should filter this worklist to a reasonable time period; otherwise, there may be hundreds of thousands of plots (or more).  Alternatively, you could plot this data as a histogram (e.g. by month or year) and compare two different time periods.  In order to get a continuous curve on the chart, it is important that you sort the worklist by spam score, since the sorted column determines the order of the records on the x-axis.  You may have to add the spam score column to the worklist first.
