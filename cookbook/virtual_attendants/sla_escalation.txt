User Excercise
==============

Try adding a `Picklist` :doc:`Custom Field</concepts/objects/custom_fields>` to `Tickets` to keep track of how high the Ticket has been escalated. This would be most useful when used in combination with a workspace filter that automatically shows the highest escalated Ticket at the top. From there, you would probably want to add another action to the Virtual Attendant to Schedule a Behavior to raise the escalation level every couple of hours if there hasn't been a response from a member of your staff.
