Relay New Messages to All Group Members
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In environments where most workers use external email clients rather than the Cerb web interface, Virtual Attendants are usually responsible for relaying new mail to workers.

Normally, each group would create a Virtual Attendant with a distribution list for relaying mail.  This is flexible, but it also requires the group manangers to constantly add and remove workers to the relay behavior.

This cookbook recipe demonstrates how to automatically relay new messages to every active member based on the group of each ticket.

**This requires Cerb 6.8.6 or later.**

Setting up the Virtual Attendant
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We'll be setting up the behavior on a global Virtual Attendant so it's implemented for all groups in a single place.  It's also possible for this behavior to only run for certain groups, but our example will run for everything.

* As an administrator, click :guilabel:`setup` in the top right navigation menu.
* In the :guilabel:`Configure` menu, select :guilabel:`Virtual Attendants`.
* Click into the desired Virtual Attendant with an owner of :guilabel:`Cerb (Application)`.  If one doesn't exist you can create it.
* Click the :guilabel:`Create Behavior` button.
* On the :guilabel:`Import` tab, paste the following::

How it works
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Behavior: Notify all group members
==================================

.. figure:: /images/cookbook/relay_entire_group/relay_to_group_trigger.png
    :figclass: bordered

Our behavior is on the :guilabel:`Message added to a conversation` event.  It runs every time a new incoming or outgoing message is added to a ticket.

It has a private list variable called :guilabel:`Group Members` of type :guilabel:`(List) Worker`.  This is used to store a list of the current group members.

Decision: Is this a new ticket?
===============================

.. figure:: /images/cookbook/relay_entire_group/behavior_decision_new.png
    :figclass: bordered

This decision asks whether the ticket is new.  The first matching outcome will be used.

Outcome: Yes
============

.. figure:: /images/cookbook/relay_entire_group/behavior_outcome_yes.png
    :figclass: bordered
    
The :guilabel:`Yes` outcome is used when the current message is incoming and the first message in a conversation.

Action: Find group members
==========================

.. figure:: /images/cookbook/relay_entire_group/behavior_action_find_members.png
    :figclass: bordered
    
This action sets the :guilabel:`Group Members` list variable with the results of the following worklist.

.. figure:: /images/cookbook/relay_entire_group/behavior_action_find_members_worklist.png
    :figclass: bordered
    
This worklist returns all the members of the group of the current ticket using the :guilabel:`{{group_id}}` placeholder.  This placeholder will change for each incoming message.

Action: Relay to group members
==============================

.. figure:: /images/cookbook/relay_entire_group/behavior_action_relay_members.png
    :figclass: bordered

Once the list of group members is set, this action uses it in the :guilabel:`Relay to:` option to send each worker a copy of the message.  Workers can then reply to these messages from their external mail client and those responses will be relayed to the ticket participants.
