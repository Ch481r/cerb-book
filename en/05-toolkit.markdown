## The "Toolkit" mentality ##

Over the past 9 years we've built up a library of reusable web-based tools that can be applied to a wide variety of business requirements.  When we think about solving new problems or implementing interesting feedback, we think in terms of these tools that we have at our disposal.  The Cerb5 project has been strangely fortunate to spend a decade refining a set of business challenges that are essentially unsolvable; our improvements over time can leverage technology to make you faster, more efficient, and more informed -- but there isn't going to be a point in the future where anyone can declare that they've solved online collaboration once and for all.  Ideally, your company will continue to grow for countless years to come, and information will continue to grow at an exponential rate, while becoming increasingly interconnected.  You're always going to be looking for new tools to mine that data to better understand the needs of your community, and to improve your efforts.  There will always be room for improvement.

Cerb5 is a repository of your community contacts, a communications crossroads, and a storehouse for your past collaborative energies and accumulated team knowledge.  This makes it an ideal place for us to provide you with a platform for ongoing development and innovation.  There are more interesting things to work on than we could hope to accomplish in a hundred careers.  Recognizing this, we've focused our energy on building open source tools that allow any company to spend their valuable time directly attacking the problems that they find interesting and important, rather than reinventing the web-based wheel.  Interesting approaches can be shared with others who can help further improve them.

As a toolkit, it is not our intention to quixotically try and replace all the other applications that you currently use with a single package from a single vendor.  There are thousands of projects out there striving to be the best mailing list software, the best billing suite, the best social network, the best community forums, the best project management software, and so on.  The _"best"_ in every situation is relative to the needs of particular groups of users.  It is impossible for a single application to make everyone happy.  You should benefit from the energy of developers who are running projects that are deeply invested in improving the challenges that you face -- but you also don't want to end up managing fifteen different copies of your customer information in isolated islands of software that aren't interested in talking to each other.

If each application has to integrate with all the others, then you're going to spend an incredible amount of time and money tying lose ends together.  Your team members will have a dozen browser windows open, with a dozen tabs in each one, trying to navigate the confusion.  What you need is a piece of infrastructure in the middle that synchronizes information: what you're hearing on social networks, what customers owe in invoices, what the last thing said in email was, what each member of your team needs to work on, and what they need to know.  This infrastructure doesn't have to be your billing system, your forums, and your issue tracker -- it just needs to be very efficient at moving information around, forming relationships within and between data, and providing a single location for your team to monitor and be notified about everything else.
