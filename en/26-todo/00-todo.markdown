# [TODO]: Topics to cover #

## Updating the helpdesk to a new version ##

## Backing up your helpdesk data ##

## Scheduler `/cron` ##

special options (pop3 max, parse max, ignore wait, loglevel, etc)

## Ticket statuses ##

* Open
* Waiting for reply
* Closed
* Deleted

## Anti-spam ##

If a conversation is junk mail, and you want to avoid wasting time with mail like it in the future, be sure to mark it as spam rather than simply deleting it.  You also shouldn't mark these conversations as _closed_ because they will be preserved forever, causing clutter in your database, wasting space in backups, reducing search performance, etc.

How it works...
