# Maintenance #

Maintenance is an important part of any software package that stores a large amount of data. Whether this information is stored on the disk or in a database, removing unnecessary data and backing it up is crucial to ensuring your data is secure. It's also important to keep your application as up to date as possible, as bugs are frequently fixed and there are occasional security updates as well.
