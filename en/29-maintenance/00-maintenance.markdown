# Maintenance #

Maintenance is an important part of any software package that stores a large amount of data over a long time period. Whether this information is stored on the disk or in a database, removing unnecessary data and backing it up is crucial to ensuring your software is operating efficiently and securely. It's also important to keep your application as up to date as possible -- bugs are fixed frequently, usability nags are improved, and there is the occasional security update.
