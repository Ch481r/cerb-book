## The basics in 60 seconds ##

You only need to understand a few concepts to get started:

* A **ticket** is a specific e-mail conversation and all the related data about a question or issue. Each ticket has a unique identifier for future reference by anyone involved.

* The people on the originating end of tickets are called **recipients**. A ticket can have multiple recipients.

* The people on the answering end of tickets are called **workers**.

* A **watcher** is a worker who receives copies of messages. For example, a supervisor may be a watcher to monitor the quality of the messages workers are writing back to requesters.

* The **helpdesk** is a software hub for centrally managing and archiving tickets, and routing messages between workers and recipients. This allows several workers to receive and share email without **recipients** writing to any of them individually.

* A **bucket** is a container for storing similar tickets. Common buckets are: Leads, Receipts, Newsletters, Refunds and Spam.

* A **group** is several workers who share responsibility for the same tickets and buckets. Common groups are: Sales, Support, Development, Billing and Corporate. These particular examples are departments, but groups can be related by anything.

* A worker in a group is called a **member**. A member with the authority to modify the group is called a **manager**. Groups can have any number of managers.

* Each group has an **inbox** where new tickets are delivered by default. These tickets are then moved into buckets either automatically by the helpdesk or by workers.
