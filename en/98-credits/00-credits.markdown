## Technology ##

* [PHP](http://www.php.net/) is a widely-used general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development.
	* We use PHP for the majority of the application logic of Cerb5 and Devblocks.
* [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) is the world's most popular open source database.
	* We use MySQL to persist all long-lived data.
* [Devblocks](http://www.devblocks.com/) is a commercial open-source framework by WebGroup Media LLC for rapid PHP5 Application Development which provides many reusable "nuts and bolts" services. This approach lets your team spend more time solving your project's target problem.  It has been heavily influenced by over 9 years of experience working on Cerberus Helpdesk (Cerb5), agile methodologies like extreme programming, and many innovative frameworks like Eclipse/RCP (cross-platform native desktop apps in Java), Tapestry (web development), and Hibernate (object relational mapping).
	* Devblocks provides the application framework, development platform, and software architecture philosophy for all Cerb5 functionality and plugins.  Without Devblocks there is chaos.
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) is a fast and concise JavaScript Library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. jQuery is designed to change the way that you write JavaScript.
	* We use jQuery for all of the Ajax and dynamic web-based functionality.
* [jQuery UI](http://jqueryui.com/) provides abstractions for low-level interaction and animation, advanced effects and high-level, themeable widgets, built on top of the jQuery JavaScript Library, that you can use to build highly interactive web applications.
	* We use jQuery UI for the majority of the interface components: tabs, dialogs, autocomplete, drag & drop sorting, effects, etc.
* [Smarty](http://www.smarty.net/) is a template engine for PHP, facilitating the separation of presentation (HTML/CSS) from application logic. This implies that PHP code is application logic, and is separated from the presentation.
	* We use Smarty to render the majority of the interface HTML and Javascript.
* [Swift Mailer](http://swiftmailer.org/) is a component-based library for sending email from PHP 5 applications.
	* We use Swift Mailer to compose MIME messages and send all outgoing mail.
* [Twig](http://www.twig-project.org/) is an open source template engine for the PHP programming language by Fabien Potencier.  It focuses on being fast, secure, and flexible.
	* We use Twig for Broadcast and Snippets functionality.
* [jqPlot](http://www.jqplot.com/) is a plotting and charting plugin for the jQuery Javascript framework. jqPlot produces beautiful line, bar and pie charts with many features.
	* We use jqPlot to draw charts on all the built-in reports.
* [qTip](http://craigsworks.com/projects/qtip/) is a tooltip plugin for the jQuery framework.
	* We use qTip to show tooltips on several reports.
* [jQuery Validation Plugin](http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/) makes simple client-side form validation trivial, while offering lots of option for customization.  The plugin is written and maintained by Jörn Zaefferer, a member of the jQuery team, lead developer on the jQuery UI team and maintainer of QUnit.
	* We use the jQuery Validation plugin to provide real-time form validation throughout the interface.
* [PHP Markdown](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/) is a PHP library for converting lightweight [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) text into HTML.
	* We provide Markdown as a format for writing knowledgebase articles.
* [Amazon S3 PHP Class](http://undesigned.org.za/2007/10/22/amazon-s3-php-class) is a PHP library by Donovan Schönknecht for working with Amazon's [S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) web service.
	* We use the Amazon S3 PHP Class to provide the option to use Amazon's S3 service as long-term storage for infrequently accessed but heavy content (e.g. message content and attachments).

## Licenses ##

* [IconExperience](http://www.iconexperience.com/) is one of the leading sources for high-quality professional icons.
	* We licensed many of the interface icons from IconExperience.
