### Toolbar ###

The conversation display page provides a toolbar for providing shortcuts to common actions.

![The conversation toolbar.](images/06-display_toolbar.png)

* **Edit** displays a popup to edit the conversation properties.
* **Close** closes the conversation.  Closed conversations are considered to be resolved.  If you want to hide a conversation that is dependent on a future date (e.g. _"We'll cancel your site at the end of the month."_) then use _Waiting for reply_ instead. A closed conversation will be reopened automatically if a recipient replies.
* **Spam** marks the current conversation as spam and delete it.  This process trains your helpdesk to become more proficient at automatically detecting spam in the future.  If a conversation is junk mail, and you want to avoid wasting time with mail like it in the future, be sure to mark it as spam rather than simply deleting it.  You also shouldn't mark these conversations as _closed_ because they will be preserved forever, causing clutter in your database, wasting space in backups, reducing search performance, etc.
* **Delete** deletes the current conversation.  After a few days of inactivity all deleted conversations are permanently purged from the helpdesk and they will be unrecoverable without database backups.  When you delete a conversation, it is the same as moving a file into the _trashcan_ on your computer.  You want to be absolutely sure that the conversation is not something you will need in the future.  If it is something you will need later, then a better option is to mark the conversation as _Closed_ or _Waiting for reply_.
* **Take** is a shortcut to assign the conversation to yourself.
* **Print** displays the conversation in a print-friendly format.
* **Refresh** refreshes the conversation.  It is exactly the same thing as refreshing a page in your browser, except that it always uses the full permalink URL for the conversation.
* **Merge** shows a popup for merging multiple conversations together.
* **more>>** displays additional actions that are less frequently used.
* **Move to** is a shortcut for moving a conversation into a new bucket.
