Plugins
-------
Plugins contribute *extensions* that expand or modify Cerb's functionality.  For example, a simple plugin may add a new tab to every ticket profile that displays external information about the sender.  Plugins can also add new record types, scheduler jobs, authentication methods, community portals, dashboard widgets, workspace page types, user interfaces, Virtual Attendant actions, etc.

Everything in Cerb comes from a *plugin* -- even the built-in functionality.  Third-party developers have access to all the tools that were used to build Cerb, and their modifications are seamlessly combined with built-in features.  This means that every time Cerb gains new built-in features, plugin developers gain new tools as well.

In general, plugins can be enabled or disabled as needed.  This allows the complexity and capabilities of Cerb to scale with the needs of a particular organization.  Access to plugins can be restricted per-role and per-worker.  Administrators can discover and install plugins through the Plugin Library, which is also capable of automatically updating plugins when new versions are released.

There are two special plugins in Cerb that are required, and they cannot be disabled:

* **Devblocks** (devblocks.core)
    This plugin contains the Devblocks web development platform, designed specifically to facilitate Cerb's philosophy of extensibility and fast-paced incremental improvement.  It provides the low-level building blocks like database access, caching, plugins, localization, patch management, scheduling, HTTP request handling, etc.
    
* **Core** (cerberusweb.core)
    This plugin implements the the higher-level building blocks that constitute Cerb: user interface elements like tabs and popups, workspaces, records, custom fields, email, worklists, dashboard widgets, workers, Virtual Attendants, community portals, etc.
