Installing the Campfire Plugin
==============================
For instructions on installing the Campfire plugin, see the documentation on :ref:`installing-a-plugin`.

The 37Signals Campfire API requires an `Auth Token` to authenticate with Campfire's API.  `Auth Tokens` are unique to each user, and you will likely want to setup a user specifically for Cerb.  These credentials must be entered when you first enable the plugin for it to work properly.  To obtain your `Auth Token`, follow the steps below.

Obtaining your Campfire Credentials
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Login to your Campfire account and click the :guilabel:`My info` link in the upper-right hand corner to obtain your `Auth Token`.
